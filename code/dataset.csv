We are being rightfully rewarded with daily case rates of five per cent what they were weeks ago, and with the relaxation of health guidelines that will allow us to fully enjoy the summer. After such a long and burdensome year and a half of fear, restrictions and loss, this is very welcome news. However, the question remains, are we done with COVID-19? Is this the end, the start of the end, or just another chapter in the story? and further lockdowns No one knows for sure, but considering the global state of vaccinations, virus cases, variants and waves, it would at least be prudent to be prepared for more cases. Even if it is a slim chance of another wave, what are the downsides to planning over the summer? It is time to take what has been learned across the globe and prepare the best plan in the event of another wave - or waves - coming our way. To address the falsely presented dichotomy of economics versus health, we have collaborated to suggest a path forward that respects our society's public health and economic needs. Here is our three-step plan for the province to follow, starting right now. Firstly, vaccinations are the best protection against further waves. Canada has among the highest rates of vaccination in the world when it comes to first doses, but we must not stop until every single person, including children, is vaccinated. This is by far our best defence against COVID and its variants, and we must not waiver in pressing for everyone to be protected. Businesses and public institutions need to implement incentives to encourage the full vaccination of employees and stakeholders. At the first hint of a new wave, we encourage all businesses and public institutions to limit in-person access to only those who are vaccinated. Why should we all suffer in lockdowns when most of us have been responsible by getting the vaccine? Why should businesses have to close because a small minority of people have not taken the responsible action of being vaccinated? Some will ask, ""what about those who cannot get vaccinated?"" From a medical perspective, this is an exceedingly tiny group, at the very most it will be a very small sliver of the population. Choosing not to get vaccinated is a personal choice, and that is fine. But, there should be consequences for those who choose not to get vaccinated, not for the rest of us who are doing our part by getting vaccinated as an important contribution to overall public health. With an adequate supply of vaccines, there are almost no valid reasons left to not be vaccinated. Secondly, we need to be much more sophisticated in understanding and addressing the stealth nature of the COVID virus. This virus has three distinctive challenges: it is highly contagious (with variants being even more contagious), it transfers through people without necessarily showing itself (i.e. asymptomatic patients), and it is deadly. Now is the time to stockpile and develop protocol and training for massive distribution of rapid tests so if another wave hits, we can use the U.K. at-home test system to allow people to know immediately if they have contracted COVID, allow for quick contact tracing to stop the spread, and isolate only those who pose a risk to others. After 18 months, less than one per cent of Canadians have contracted COVID, but we continue to feel our only tool is a 100 per cent lockdown that harms all. It is time to smarten up. The third thing we need to do is support others around the world to have access to vaccines, and to take vaccines as the strongest means to combat COVID. In Canada, we have one of the highest adoption rates of vaccines (first dose, but growing in second doses), but we are constantly at risk as the virus transmits globally. COVID has shown itself as appearing, then retracting in waves. We are entering a low point in the wave. No one knows for sure if a new wave will crest, but why wait until we are once again scrambling to get on top of the situation? Now is the time to fully prepare with a new battle plan for the next wave.

OPINION: It's time to follow the scientific method -- and re-evaluate Canada's COVID approach,https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-its-time-to-follow-the-scientific-method-and-re-evaluate-canadas-covid-approach,torontosun.com,"By: Claus Rinner, Donald G. Welsh, Jan Vrbik, John Zwaagstra, Laurent Leduc and Valentina Capurri",['Special To Toronto Sun'],2021-06-06 00:00:00,"Photo by Luke Hendry / Luke Hendry Did you know that the average age of Canada's COVID-19 deaths in 2020 was almost 84 years, while the average age at death in Canada in 2019 was only 76.5 years? You would think that these Statistics Canada data published on June 1 would give politicians, public health officials, and the media reason to re-examine the threat of SARS-CoV-2 and consider age-specific response measures. An extraordinary burden is put on children, youths, and young families, who are at virtually no risk from the virus nor contribute significantly to its transmission. And blanket emergency orders are being extended for the nth time, although they have been only marginally effective over the last 15 months. We are a group of academics with PhDs spanning the natural and social sciences as well as the humanities. What we have in common is a daily practice of critical thinking and following the scientific method. Science continuously questions previous findings, explores new approaches, and validates or refutes them with evidence. As scientists and scholars, we categorically reject the notion that ""the science is settled"". Science never settles. What we know about COVID-19 has changed over the last 15 months. For example, did you know that asymptomatic transmission is no longer considered relevant for SARS-CoV-2 spread? Yet, why are the implications of the updated science on mask mandates and social distancing not being discussed? How could one-half of the United States go safely back to the old normal with no mask mandates, distancing rules, or vaccine requirements, while the province of Ontario maintains one of the tightest restrictions of civil liberties in the world? Why are dissenting doctors silenced by their professional organizations and the media, instead of being listened to and cross-examined? In early 2020, asymptomatic transmission was suspected to pose a risk large enough to respond to the novel coronavirus with unprecedented lockdowns and mobility restrictions. Normally, any important government policy is subject to a cost-benefit analysis - why was this not done for the COVID-19 measures? Independent Canadian researchers predict a devastating toll: one study estimates that 5-10 times more life is lost due to lockdowns (measured in years of life lost prematurely, i.e. Canadians dying earlier than they would without lockdowns), as compared to any lives that may have been saved, and another study pegs the costs at up to 282 times greater than the benefits. The collateral damage of lockdowns on our emotional, physical, and mental health is increasingly coming to light. And so is the impact of mobility restrictions on the fabric of society: for more than one year, we have been encouraged to refrain from regular social contact and to perceive those around us as carriers of disease and death. Considering that humans are social beings, this is an unprecedented experiment that might have devastating long-term effects, especially on children. The United States has been a political battlefield for different approaches to responding to COVID-19. Consider California versus Florida. California imposed full dining closures and stay-at-home mandates in November-December 2020, whereas Florida had lifted most restrictions as early as September 2020. Despite California's strict measures, the daily death counts attributed to COVID19 continued to rise during the third wave and peaked in January-February 2021. A similar rise was seen in Florida but the peak level was lower than for California, followed by a steady decrease. Florida has done remarkably well, health-wise and economically, throughout the pandemic and that with a population more than half that of Canada squeezed into a landmass similar to Nova Scotia. It does not take a degree in medicine or public health to see the possibility that the threat of SARS- CoV-2 was greatly exaggerated and the Western world's pandemic response badly mismanaged. It is extremely dangerous to suppress diverging analyses and censor opposing views, as has been happening with respect to COVID-19 in mainstream and social media, in the public sphere and at the workplace, and even in our universities and parliaments. If we do not maintain careful checks and balances on government and public health officials, we run the risk of taking the wrong path for too long. This is the situation we are facing right now, and it is imperative that we stop and retrace our steps to find a sensible, sustainable way to deal with SARS- CoV-2, as we do with other endemic viruses. This country has to fully re-open and get back to normal life, along with restoring long-established pandemic preparedness.

"Economic Underperformance, Excessive Indebtedness, and Our Constrained Future",https://www.macvw.ca/research/2020/9/9/economic-underperformance-excessive-indebtedness-and-our-constrained-future,www.macvw.ca,,['Kari Lancaster'],2020-07-25 12:46:00,"With last week's federal deficit announcement, it is now more important than ever that we acknowledge our current realities with detail and clarity. We otherwise will be unable to develop a believable and effective path forward in the post-COVID world. The problem is that our current realities are uncomfortably negative. Many of us just don't want to see this or believe it. We were in a slow-moving crisis of competitiveness, investment, and productivity prior to the COVID lockdown. Now, we have both stagnant productivity and excessive levels of debt. This feels negative as most of us understandably want to feel positive and optimistic about our future. However, for optimism to be real it must be grounded in reality. It is only then we can develop a believable and inspiring vision, and the appropriate strategies to recover and rebuild our economy. Prior to the COVID lockdown, the economic fundamentals in Canada were already grim: As a Canadian, if you were fortunate enough to accumulate savings, the last thing you should have done is to invest in Canadian companies on Canadian stock exchanges. We were in a state of investment, competitive, and economic underperformance before the pandemic-related collapse. ""Going back to normal"" or ""the way things were"" is going back to a set of conditions that were compromising the future for all Canadians. And now, we have the added reality of excessive debt. The inevitable consequence is a loss of financial flexibility, less capacity to spend, and more financial risk in the event of an extended recession, additional intermittent lockdowns, or some other new, unforeseen crisis. Although the financial position of our federal government was reasonable going into the COVID lockdown (debt to GDP ratio was 35%), this has all changed seemingly overnight. With a $350 billion deficit, we are now adding about 15% to the debt to GDP ratio. Maybe this still doesn't look too alarming, however, we are missing a large part of the picture if we ignore the provinces. We have learned in crisis that the national government will be called upon to backstop the credit demands of all provinces, and to a certain extent, even corporate and household debt. Ontario's debt is now about $400 billion, Quebec $200 billion, and then there are the other provinces. The Western provinces, including Manitoba, are now close to approximately $150 billion. The Atlantic provinces represent another $50 billion in debt. If you're keeping track, that's $800 billion of provincial debt combined with now over $1 trillion of federal debt. Total ""all in"" government debt is now at least $1.8 trillion and heading towards $2.0 trillion which would be 100% of GDP - that represents over $50,000 for every man woman and child in Canada, or $200,000 for a household of four. Analysts and economists tend to look at debt solely on the basis of decision-making authority and responsibility at the entity level, as this is where insolvency would occur. This is why most don't aggregate debt. But aside from insolvency risk, the key problem with debt that's often overlooked is how it constrains choice and optionality. The aggregation of choice and commitment drives our overall economy. Understanding our economic outlook requires accounting for the burden of debt across all decision-making entities. The government debt described above is layered on top of consumer and corporate debt. Total consumer debt in Canada is at a record $2.3 trillion which includes $1.6 trillion of mortgages. Household debt to disposable income is now at a record high of 181%. Corporate debt in Canada is also at record levels of about $2.4 trillion and based on the Bank of International Settlements, our corporate debt service ratio is among the highest in the world. Total household, corporate, and government debt is about $7.0 trillion. This is 350% on a $2 trillion economy. The one thing we know about debt is that if you can survive through a downturn, it will constrain choice; it will constrain the scope and flexibility of decision-making commitments. This will be the new reality for many decision makers across the entire economy. You can reasonably expect that consumers and corporations will be spending less and repairing balance sheets, and governments at all levels will be forced to be more accountable and discerning in spending and borrowing. All of this will likely be a net drag on the economy for years. Unfortunately, this is all happening at the same time that Canada's GDP per capita and labour productivity have been lagging. The issue of productivity must be emphasized. To quote Nobel Laureate economist, Paul Krugman: ""Productivity isn't everything, but in the long run it is almost everything. A country's ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise output per worker."" Canada is now in an era of both stagnating productivity, low competitiveness, and excessive levels of indebtedness. In the corporate investment world, we often describe this as a ""strategic straightjacket"" - with less choice and less freedom to move. All of this should encourage a reset in priorities towards fiscal constraint, incentivizing investment, and pursuing more business-friendly policies and strategies that will tilt towards increasing innovation, productivity, and prosperity."
Opinion: Why we’re not doing better on COVID vaccines,https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-why-were-not-doing-better-on-covid-vaccines,financialpost.com,Liberal government pharmaceutical policy has failed Canadians at our time of greatest need,"['Paul Lucas', 'Special To Financial Post']",2021-01-14 00:00:00,"Photo by Arnold Jerocki/Getty Images As the CEO of GlaxoSmithKline Canada (GSK) for 16 years, now retired for nine, I was deeply involved in the production and distribution of the Canadian vaccine for the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, working collaboratively with public health and other government officials. All the vaccine for that pandemic was produced in the GSK factory in Quebec City. The campaign, after a few initial snags, was a tremendous success. The vaccine was developed, rolled out and injected into millions of Canadians in just several months. I felt compelled to write about the current vaccine supply situation when federal Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs Dominic Leblanc erroneously stated on CTV's Power Play that we don't have any domestic vaccine production in Canada because ""GSK closed its facility during the Harper years."" In fact, that facility is still operational and manufactures much of Canada's annual flu vaccine. As of this writing Canada ranks tenth in the world in COVID vaccine doses administered per 100 population. This is surprising considering Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has consistently stated that ""We are better on vaccines than just about every other country."" The provinces have worked out their logistics issues and are not the problem. The problem is clearly that the federal government is not able to procure significant doses of vaccine until April. Canada will receive 1.2 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccine by the end of January and six million doses by the end of March. That will allow the vaccination of approximately three million citizens - less than 10 per cent of the population. Many other countries have received significantly more vaccine on a population-adjusted basis. The question is: Why is Canada not able to acquire more vaccine early? Not surprisingly, the industry has gone elsewhere to invest - to places like the U.K., the U.S. and the EU where that positive environment does exist. They are all performing better than Canada on early vaccine acquisition. A senior public health official in Israel recently stated that one of the reasons that country was able to acquire large quantities of doses was its good relationship with the pharmaceutical industry. This unfavourable environment has its roots in the Trudeau government of 1968 and the effective elimination of pharmaceutical patents. That lead to the hollowing-out of the innovative industry and the emergence of a generic-company oligopoly that was supported by successive Liberal governments. The Mulroney and Harper governments supported the innovative industry by improving the patent landscape but Canada only partially recovered and to this day does not have globally competitive patent protection. The negative trend continues even now with the imminent implementation of a punitive pricing regime through new federal (Patented Medicine Price Review Board) regulations. One now has to ask: where are the generic companies when we badly need innovation? . Is Canada unable to acquire early vaccines because the federal government was late negotiating contracts with companies as it attempted to acquire domestic supply by funding three or four opportunities, including collaboration on the CanSino vaccine from China, that frankly had virtually no chance of succeeding? Or is it because Canada may not have been willing to pay a per-dose price that would have ensured significant early supply? Or, finally, is our initial supply small because Canada provided little to no funding for the development of the vaccines, unlike the contributions made by the U.S., U.K. and Germany? Operation Warp Speed in the U.S. contributed $12 billion to support accelerated development and manufacturing. It should be no surprise that the U.S. now has large quantities of vaccine. When it comes to vaccine supply Canada should be in the same position as these other leading countries. Instead, we are three to four months behind. How many more people will die in this pandemic who wouldn't have if the federal government had done a better job acquiring more early doses? How many more businesses will fail? How long will the lockdowns go on? Months matter in this struggle. Days matter. Unfortunately, Canadians are paying a steep price. Moving forward, Canada should start preparing for the inevitable next pandemic by establishing a constructive partnership between the federal government and the innovative pharmaceutical/life sciences industry. Canada needs to position the sector as one of our strategic industries - which, incredibly, it currently is not. The government needs to build a policy platform that will make Canada globally competitive in attracting innovation and investment. Part of that investment has to be domestic pandemic vaccine manufacturing capability. There should be no excuses next time.

Opinion: The conservative path to a fairer country,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-the-conservative-path-to-a-fairer-country,nationalpost.com,"Ako Ufodike and William Luke: Sound conservative values, such as fiscal responsibility, an economy that works for all, fairness, opportunity, self-reliance,…","['Ako Ufodike', 'William Luke', 'Special To National Post']",2020-06-06 00:00:00,"Ako Ufodike and William Luke: Sound conservative values, such as fiscal responsibility, an economy that works for all, fairness, opportunity, self-reliance, respect for the rule of law and personal freedom are essential if we hope to level the socioeconomic playing field Photo by Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press In the midst of a global pandemic, many around the world have been deeply disturbed by the alleged murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in broad daylight. Even more shocking was the fact that three of his fellow officers actively participated. Second-degree murder charges have been laid against the officer who pressed his knee on Floyd's neck, and the others have now been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. The debate that has ensued in Canada in the aftermath has been mixed, with some acknowledging that racism exists in Canada, and others outright denying it. The reality is that Canada, much like the United States, has a history of social injustice and economic inequality between different racial groups. This goes as far back as the first contact between Europeans and Indigenous peoples. Over the centuries, the economic and political imbalances between communities have been redefined with each new wave of immigration, as evidenced by the fact that we scrapped and denounced the head tax, only to impose another variant of it - a now normalized right of landing fee. Racism towards various minority groups exists in Canada still, and anti-black racism is a real problem and is certainly a cause of frustration, but we believe that there is hope. Through solid political and civic engagement with our democratic institutions, social and economic justice can be achieved. Canadian values and, in particular, true conservative principles, have and will continue to shape a fairer and more inclusive Canada. An essential first step is to recognize and admit that there are social and economic challenges to overcome. Photo by JEAN LEVAC/Postmedia Take the current COVID-19 crisis, for example. Data shows that visible minority groups in Canada have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic and the economic fallout resulting from the tough social-distancing measures that have been put in place. This is coming on top of endemic economic and health crises in these communities, yet Canada still refuses to collect ethnicity-related health and mortality data, in contrast to many other OECD countries, including the U.S. According to Statistics Canada, approximately one in four Canadians could become financially vulnerable due to work interruptions and economic lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This is particularly concerning for visible minority groups. The Ontario Anti-Racism Directorate's 2017 community consultations found that black-Canadians face major obstacles when looking for employment. Even though the black community has achieved much success in many sectors, systemic discrimination puts a significant section of the community at risk. This is especially true during periods of great economic uncertainty, such as we find ourselves in today. Marginalized communities are negatively impacted in many other ways, as well, including: over-representation in the criminal justice system; lower levels of educational attainment; poorer health and quality of life; restricted access to capital and less property ownership. These outcomes reinforce systemic barriers. The Association of Black Conservatives (ABC) actively promotes civic engagement and political participation because these are the proven pathways towards reform. It is only through active engagement in democratic politics at all levels - municipal, provincial and federal - that real and lasting systemic change can be achieved. Photo by Carlos Osorio/Reuters Moreover, it is critical that all communities, particularly disadvantaged communities, engage with all political parties and not just left-leaning parties that act as though they are entitled to the visible minority vote. It is essential that marginalized communities are not just in the room, but are also in decision-making positions. This is not about quotas; it is about diversity. Canada needs to come to terms with the fact that our standards regarding diversity and equity fails to meet acceptable standards in 2020. Sound conservative values, such as fiscal responsibility, an economy that works for all, fairness, opportunity, self-reliance, respect for the rule of law and personal freedom are essential if we hope to level the socioeconomic playing field and allow communities and individuals to thrive. Economic inequality and social injustice are enduring problems that require sound policies and political commitment. ABC believes in advancing the principles of equity and inclusion for the black-Canadian community and all Canadians. As we look to build a better and stronger country after COVID-19, persistent socioeconomic inequalities in visible minority groups can no longer be overlooked. The True North is stronger and freer when individuals can reach their full potential. We are, after all, our brothers' and sisters' keepers.

When international travel restrictions took effect last March, they mobilized to bring home Canadians who were stranded abroad. They were among the first air carriers anywhere to require passengers to wear masks, to provide crews with state-of-the-art personal protective equipment and to implement stringent aircraft cleaning. For months, the industry has worked with scientists and public health officials to explore the effectiveness of various quarantine periods and to evaluate testing and rapid screening as ways to protect travellers and borders. They did all of this without question, despite the fact that few COVID-19 cases in Canada are attributed to travel exposures and there are no documented cases of onboard transmissions in Canada. This past weekend, at the prime minister's request, they took the unprecedented step of suspending all flights to the Caribbean and Mexico. Simultaneously, they overhauled their schedules to ensure that in-bound international flights land in one of only four cities: Montreal, Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver. These latest moves will inflict further financial damage on a sector that is already hemorrhaging cash, having experienced declines in passenger traffic of as much as 95 per cent. In light of this, it is both baffling and tragic that - more than 10 months into the pandemic - the federal government still has not brought forward a comprehensive plan to save the industry from financial collapse. When the first COVID-19 lockdowns were announced last spring, Ottawa's official position was that it did not want to waste valuable time creating a range of ""sector-specific"" business support programs. It chose instead to roll out broad-based initiatives such as the federal wage subsidy, which was designed to help any employer that experienced a significant drop in revenues. That approach might have sufficed had the health emergency lasted only a few months, but it long ago stopped making sense. Only major changes to existing relief programs would have made them effective for the long haul. No other group of major employers in Canada has been hit as hard as the airlines. At Air Canada and WestJet alone, well over 30,000 skilled workers have lost their jobs. In the aviation sector overall, almost half of all members of Unifor, Canada's largest private-sector union, have either been laid off, furloughed or had their jobs eliminated. In last September's throne speech, the federal government hinted that financial support was on the way. Yet here we are in February and the industry is still waiting. Apart from Italy, Canada is the only country in the G7 that has not offered major financial aid to its domestic air carriers. What are we waiting for? Without government assistance, a vital part of Canada's national strategic infrastructure will suffer serious damage, causing long-term harm for Canadians. Airlines, airports and the rest of Canada's aviation sector are essential not just to the economy, but to countless communities from coast to coast to coast. The longer Ottawa delays, the more costly the consequences. To survive, airlines have been forced to drastically cut back their routes, leaving some communities with no flights at all. On top of that, training programs to replace retiring air traffic controllers have been cancelled, which will inevitably lead to future shortages. Any major restart of air travel, when it comes, could be hampered if workers such as pilots, air traffic controllers and mechanics have not been able to maintain their skills and qualifications. Pilots, for example, must keep flying or risk losing their licenses. Recertifying a pilot can take as long as two years and is extremely expensive. Countries around the world have recognized that it is in their national interest to have a strong airline sector. Airlines and aviation workers connect us to the world and to one another. The industry is a vital part of Canada's trade in goods and services and a key linchpin in the tourism industry. When the pandemic ends, Canadians will once again be eager to explore our vast country and get together with loved ones. Ottawa must step in now with a plan to safely reopen the aviation sector and ensure the survival of an essential service. National Post Jerry Dias is the national president of Unifor.

The people of northwestern Ontario are getting an extra-special Christmas present from the province this year - a 14-day lockdown. The lockdown puts the Northwestern Health Unit, among the other health units in northern Ontario, into the grey zone for two weeks starting on Boxing Day. Media reports over the weekend said the lockdown was to start on Dec. 24, but apparently the dire situation Ontario is in can wait five days. We have it better up here than our southern Ontario counterparts, who will enter into a 28-day lockdown. This seems like a good idea in the south where case numbers are rising and hospitals are reaching capacity. Although, Dr. Adalsteinn Brown, a member of the premier's COVID-19 table, said on Monday that any lockdown less than four weeks isn't effective. So what is a two-week lockdown going to do exactly? What we've been doing to prevent the spread of COVID-19 has worked thus far in the northwest. We've followed the public health advice, we've washed our hands, we've stayed home when we're sick and we've worn masks in enclosed public spaces. Why are we being punished for what is going down south? Now, health officials have said that the Christmas holidays could bring more cases as people will gather in their homes, even if they shouldn't. But how is that any different than Thanksgiving, or Halloween, or Canada Day? We never saw a significant spike in the northwest after those holidays. Sure, there was a small spike after Thanksgiving, but it wasn't bad and our hospitals weren't overrun. We did move into the ""Yellow"" zone under the province's pandemic response framework in November, but our case counts have plummeted since then. A move to ""Green"" should've been on the cards, but instead, we are being shoved into our homes and business owners will have to shelf their Boxing Day sales as curbside pickup will be the only option to collect revenue. The ironic thing is, under the current restrictions, you can have a gathering of 10 people in your home, so Christmas is not even close to being cancelled. In fact, it's being enabled. But Boxing Day shopping? Not allowed. Are you scratching your head, too? January tends to be a slower month as people are recovering from the holiday hangover, and the end of December is an opportunity for retailers to cash in on people's padded Christmas wallets. The province is offering a grant to businesses, but how much will that help? To boot, ski hills are not allowed to open so Mount Evergreen won't be able to operate when kids are out of school. Premier Doug Ford said during his daily press conference on Dec. 21 that he knows what it's like to be a business owner. But does he know what it's like to be a northerner? Queen's Park needs to stop forgetting there are people who live, work and play up here in the northwest. Somehow being located next to Winnipeg, one of Canada's COVID-19 hotspots, we've kept our case counts low. Will this lockdown in the northwest send people to Winnipeg to shop? Who knows, the lockdowns in Manitoba certainly brought Manitobans here, it hasn't been an uncommon sight to see Manitoban plates roaming Kenora. It is still not cool to demonize Manitobans, by the way. Should they be here? Probably not, but you shouldn't be in Manitoba unless absolutely necessary. It's a two-way street. Ontario could also extend this lockdown, as they've introduced legislation to enable themselves to do that. So who knows how long it will last? Alas, we must deal with the cards we're dealt, so it's into isolation we go on Boxing Day. The silver lining is we live in the most beautiful part of the world to social distance outside. Take the time to go ice fishing, fire up the woodstove at camp, go for a hike or support a local restaurant and have a takeout movie night. These two weeks will hopefully fly by and we can get back to where we were before."
"Opinion: Make mask-wearing a sign of personal strength, not weakness. Lives depend on it",https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-make-mask-wearing-a-sign-of-personal-strength-not-weakness-lives-depend-on-it,nationalpost.com,Those who reject masks are motivated by the feeling of toughness derived from the kinds of associations Trump and others forge,"['Dr. Robert Danisch', 'National Post']",2020-10-14 00:00:00,"Photo by Piroschka van de Wouw/Reuters By Robert Danisch As a second wave of COVID-19 sweeps across Canada and the high tide of a first wave continues to inundate the U.S., a seemingly exasperated Dr. Theresa Tam and Dr. Anthony Fauci continue to remind North Americans to wear masks. Which begs the question, given all the evidence, and the mounting numbers of dead and hospitalized, why are some people still not wearing masks? The answer is that this is a problem of communication and persuasion, something that Tam and Fauci, despite their medical knowledge and skill, are ill-equipped to solve. Here's the difficulty: Masks work to prevent the spread of the virus and we have the data to prove it. Tam and Fauci believe that if they just give the public this information, then their jobs are done. But information doesn't motivate action, and the transmission of information doesn't accurately describe how communication or persuasion work. Communication is a process of making meaning, and persuasion is the strategic art of assigning meaning for the purpose of motivating action. Any time we introduce a new idea or object into our public culture, we have a contest over the meaning of the idea or object. This contest over meaning is inevitable. Let's consider helmets in hockey: For years hockey players thought helmets were a sign of weakness, misaligned with the general belief that hockey players were supposed to be macho and tough. The NHL had to fight this meaning in order to motivate players to wear helmets. Now very few people see helmets as a sign of weakness. This contest over meaning is inevitable In the case of the mask, we are living through a contest over what the mask means. For some, the mask means weakness, femininity, governmental overreach, or an infringement on personal freedom. A Fox News host tweeted: ""Might as well carry a purse with that mask Joe"" about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. Clearly this is an attempt to equate mask-wearing with weakness or femininity. It's called semiotic tying, when we associate one object (the mask) with another (the purse) in order to suggest that people should relate the meaning of one to the other. This is how communication and persuasion work. President Donald Trump clearly believes masks mean weakness, which is why he so often refuses to wear one. The Trump administration has tried, since the beginning of the pandemic, to strategically tie mask-wearing to weakness by suggesting that someone who wears a mask is not tough enough to take on the virus. If you explore right-wing media for a few moments, you'll find the communicative labour of tying weakness to mask-wearing and government oppression to masks. Meaning motivates action, information doesn't. The statistics we receive about COVID-19 infections will not change behaviour. Drs. Tam and Fauci want us to see masks as necessary instruments of public health. For masks to work though, we need to be motivated to wear them because of what they mean. To achieve that, we need skilled communicators to tie the meaning of mask-wearing to values that can motivate action. Instead, Tam and Fauci like to tell us what function the masks serve (that they prevent the spread of aerosolized virus from our mouths and noses). But every time they do that is a missed opportunity to participate in the contest over meaning. If we do wear a mask because of the information we get from these doctors, it's likely because we trust science and we've assigned meaningful values to science more generally. Or we do the labour ourselves of associating masks with other kinds of health and safety measures. Photo by Gavin Young/Postmedia News Those who reject mask wearing are motivated by the affective feeling of toughness derived from the kinds of associations Trump and others forge. But our government has not offered a competing, patriotic, uplifting set of associations that would motivate action in the same way. We have the slogan ""we're all in this together,"" but that slogan remains unconnected to mask-wearing and is far too generic and vague. Canada Health and the CDC can transmit as much information as they want, but that information is unlikely to produce the effects necessary to motivate action. People make decisions, who to vote for or whether to wear a mask, not based on reasonable calculations or rational deliberation. In other words, people don't think to themselves that the mask will lower their probability of getting the virus and therefore wearing one is the right thing to do. People need to be motivated to act, which requires a feeling driven by a value that derives from the meanings we associate with masks. Lives depend on the outcome of the contest over the meaning of the mask. It would be nice if Canada or the U.S. had a communication strategy that took the project of persuasion seriously, or at least understood that transmitting information was not all we need to do to motivate action. What we need now is to make mask-wearing a sign of respect, civility and patriotism. Returning our lives to normal may depend on that just as much as it depends on a vaccine.

Opinion: Political leadership needed now to tame the virus,https://thestarphoenix.com/opinion/letters/opinion-political-leadership-needed-now-to-tame-the-virus,thestarphoenix.com,That the curve we worked so hard to flatten is now rising sharply means we must demand decisive action from our government.,[],2020-11-25 00:00:00,"Photo by BRANDON HARDER / Regina Leader-Post By Nazeem Muhajarine, PhD and Kathryn L Green, ScD The average daily number of new COVID-19 cases in Saskatchewan this past week is double what it was just two weeks ago. The number of COVID patients in our hospitals is the highest it's been, and deaths are mounting. We've had eight months to learn how to control this pandemic. There is no time left to wait. Getting ahead of the virus Further delay in responding would be catastrophic. Because of the time it takes for someone to develop symptoms and get tested, the number of cases being reported today tells us less about what is going on now than about what was going on a week or more ago. Rising cases now means rising hospitalizations within a few weeks. It is hard to stay ahead of this virus. But experiences from other countries show us that the best strategy is to be proactive. In response to the recent alarming rise in cases, our provincial government finally announced a few new measures in late October and early November. Unfortunately, these public health-political actions are too little, too late. The mask mandate must be provincewide. Outside the three cities, some areas have active cases three to four times higher than in Saskatoon or Regina; for example, North Central where the per capita rate of COVID infections is the highest. Provinces like Nova Scotia and Newfoundland implemented mask mandates months earlier and now have the pandemic much more under control. Researchers have estimated that if mask mandates had been adopted across Canada in early July, the total cases per week could have been reduced by 700 to 1,100. Being proactive works. On Oct. 16, our provincial medical health officer said case numbers would have to rise to 60 per day before new restrictions were implemented. From Nov. 5 to 9, we've seen more than twice that number of new daily cases on average. What is the government waiting for? Learning from our neighbours We do not have to look far to see how quickly the pandemic can get out of control. Through the summer, Manitoba had one of the lowest COVID case rates in Canada; several weeks passed with no new cases. Then the outbreaks began, community transmission skyrocketed, and now the province has the highest number of new cases per capita in Canada. Many people attribute the sharp rise in Manitoba's cases to a false sense of security that developed because of the province's low numbers. This may have contributed to the worsening situation in Saskatchewan as well. Until recently our numbers looked pretty good. Now, more of us have family and friends testing positive. As we realize that the virus is still here, we must acknowledge that we have the power to reduce its spread through our actions. To the west, Alberta's per capita case numbers have consistently been among the highest in the country. It is currently second after Manitoba. Its government, like ours, is resolute about not issuing a second lockdown order and has resisted mandating masks provincewide. The dramatic rise in cases in Western Canada means simply that we are not doing enough. No one wants to return to the widespread, months-long lockdown we endured this spring. But governments must employ more specific types of restrictions. Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba and B.C. have all brought in targeted restrictions, focused on hot spots. Where these are insufficient, a short, sharp lockdown may be needed in order to break the chain of viral spread. Simply asking everyone to do the right thing is not working. So government must act. Public health restrictions and recommendations are only successful to the extent that the public follows them. If the public will not follow them voluntarily, they have to be made mandatory. Each and every one of us has to do our part to keep the virus from spreading. Citizens' responsibility is to minimize the number of people they come in close contact with, wear a mask inside public spaces, stay home when not feeling well, and keep up the hand washing. And our government's responsibility is to listen to public health advice and not be afraid to implement the kinds of decisive measures required to bring the pandemic back under control. The time to act is now. Dr. Nazeem Muhajarine is an epidemiologist and professor, Community Health and Epidemiology, College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan.

Opinion: Consider essential visitations to long-term care homes,https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-consider-essential-visitations-to-long-term-care-homes,leaderpost.com,"With vigilance, long-term care homes should allow visitors to help with crucial needs as allowed under SHA guidelines, writes Roslyn Compton.",['Roslyn M. Compton'],2020-12-17 00:00:00,"Photo by GETTY In long-term care family presence is critical. This is even more evident during a pandemic. The Saskatchewan Health Authority's policy for family presence to support compassionate care in LTC is applied to ""residents in long term care (LTC) and special care homes where it is determined that the resident's quality of life and/or care needs cannot be met without the assistance of a family member or support person."" Quality of life is very broad. It extends beyond basic health and personal care needs, such as helping someone eat or get dressed and includes psychological, emotional and social needs. These needs can be difficult or impossible for staff to meet on their own and are critical for the health and well-being of residents. The policy names specific situations that indicate unmet needs, including physical and/or mental health decline, a significant change in family presence since the pandemic began, and poor ability to participate meaningfully in virtual or outdoor visitations. It is the resident or the family member/support person who determine if quality of care and/or care needs cannot be met without the assistance of a designated family member or support person in collaboration with the care team. Unfortunately, the public and some LTC administrators have come to mistakenly understand that the policy restricts all visiting in LTC except end-of-life care. Despite clear policies defining criteria for safe family presence, more limiting restrictions have been implemented in many LTC homes to control and limit family presence. The misinterpretations continue to create hardship and distress for so many, at an already challenging time in this pandemic. It is true that limits and restrictions are necessary to control risk during a pandemic, and that one person's well-being should not be pitted against another's. The SHA's family presence policy does address this. For example, family members need to follow screening and infection control practices. Strict ‘no visitor' policies were implemented early in the pandemic when less was known about COVID-19 presentation and transmission. There was limited access to testing, and homes were scaling up infection prevention and control approaches, and personal protective equipment access. These deficiencies have been addressed now and there has been a shift in visitor policy across Canada and globally to reduce the detrimental effects of prolonged lockdowns on residents, families, and staff. There is growing evidence that locking families out results in physical and psychosocial harm to residents, families, and staff. It must be acknowledged that each person and family have their own level of risk tolerance. Some families have found virtual connections work well and keep them and their own community contacts safe and satisfied. Some do not want to take the chance of taking COVID-19 into the care setting. Some are practising physical distancing rigorously to protect their own health. Provinces in Canada have moved to support safe, but limited family presence. Saskatchewan can keep pace with the full implementation of the current SHA policy. Across the continuum of care, group homes, personal care homes, and LTC homes (including those owned by or affiliated with SHA) should be supported and accountable to consistently apply SHA policy. As the long months of the pandemic continue, we must move quickly to reunite families and LTC residents. We have a great deal to gain since much of the care provided in Canadian LTC homes is normally provided by families. Permitting families to resume their caregiving roles has potential to increase resident quality of life, reduce excess mortality due to social isolation, prevent residents from dying in the absence of family, and reduce the moral distress and work-related burden LTC staff are carrying when they feel they must try to ""replace"" the love and attention of family members, knowing this is neither morally nor physically possible. We do not call for opening the doors of LTC widely to all visitors at a time when community risk is high. We call instead for the implementation of the existing SHA policy to support residents and care teams in LTC. We must always accept family presence as an essential element of quality of life in LTC.

She writes on behalf of the Saskatchewan Long Term Care Network, a group of family members, researchers, clinicians and trainees that contribute evidence- and experience-informed strategies to support long-term care stakeholders.

STUDIN: Canada won't return to normal without more fight,https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-canada-wont-return-to-normal-without-more-fight,torontosun.com,What’s with all this loose talk of a second mass lockdown in Canada? A proud country must not go to the gallows so lightly.,['Irvin Studin'],2020-10-06 00:00:00,"Photo by Olivier Douliery / AFP via Getty Images / Files Canada may be in the throes of a real pandemic, but it is the mindless, pious ""theatre"" of COVID that is driving our fair land ever deeper into economic and strategic depression. Beyond the objective COVID numbers, this COVID theatre comprises the antisocial, antieconomic and self-defeating rituals that have caused Canada to contort into an increasingly tight knot of intellectual, administrative, commercial and behavioural passivity from which the country will not be able to escape for any foreseeable future. The ""system"" in Canada will not fix itself on the current logic of things. Our national stupor requires not caressing and succour, but rather courageous circuit-breakers. The first lockdown succeeded in driving thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses across the country out of existence. It resulted in thousands of young Canadians effectively defecting from formal schooling. When all is said and done, there will have to be a proper moral accounting of these calamitous, perfectly avoidable outcomes. A second lockdown would only succeed in destroying many thousands more businesses and collapsing several already-destabilized public-school systems across the country. To be clear, these would be historical policy crimes. The implicit ""contract"" between government and citizens during lockdown holds that, in exchange for the obedience and inactivity of the population, those authorities enacting and enforcing the lockdown will do everything legally and humanly possible to save lives and livelihoods. In any lockdown scenario, then, government leaders and civil servants cannot assume a 9 a.m.-to-5 p.m. existence. They cannot presume to govern only by Zoom and abstract decree. Nay, they must provide the missing energy to the society forced to quarantine, and therefore cannot allow a family business built through decades' worth of toil, blood and treasure to simply go extinct without exhausting every line of direct communication, support and aggressive remedy. The same applies to students cut from schools during lockdown and unable to return to real education post-lockdown. Allowing Canadian children to be raised without proper schooling is a near-death sentence for young people forced to reckon, upon graduation, with a far less stable Canada and more wicked post-pandemic world. Ten months into the pandemic, our testing capacity, systems and technologies remain primitive at best and third-world at worst. Clearly, the work to get this right was not put in during the last quarantine, and so a second mass quarantine would be imposed on the strength of half-baked numbers and a lazy national capture by the degenerate daily loop of COVID case counts - a count that by now can only have meaning if juxtaposed with effective unemployment rates approaching 20%, huge jumps in homelessness, and massive rises in mental health and other public health afflictions across the country. We Canadians have a huge fight on our hands. Now is not the time for passivity or theatre. The fight is less about the future ""ends"" than about the energy with which we Canadians must exit the multiple crises in which the country finds itself. Whether our post-pandemic reality is to be ""green"" or ""purple"" or ""orange"" is of lesser consequence than the need for Canada to pivot out of the COVID emergency kinetically and with a national sense of mission. Without such energy and purpose, we will get nowhere fast as a country. But with it, we give Canada a fighting chance to emerge from this tragedy as still one of the world's most admired countries. - Studin is president of the Institute for 21st Century Questions, and editor-in-chief and publisher of Global Brief Magazine.

Guest Opinion: Trudeau and Biden peddling climate change alarmism,https://calgarysun.com/opinion/letters/guest-opinion-trudeau-and-biden-peddling-climate-change-alarmism,calgarysun.com,"Climate alarmism, or at least the desire to appease alarmists for political benefit, fuels much of the federal regulatory agenda in both Canada and the United…",['Matthew Lau'],2021-02-12 00:00:00,"Photo by Wayne Cuddington / Postmedia Climate alarmism, or at least the desire to appease alarmists for political benefit, fuels much of the federal regulatory agenda in both Canada and the United States. There are, as American examples, President Joe Biden cancelling federal permits for the Keystone XL pipeline and the goings-on this year at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission where the chairman (appointed by Biden) made climate disclosures a top priority. Mandating climate disclosures is premised on the idea that financial markets fail to properly account for climate change risks; thus, the government should force companies to disclose such risks and how they plan to mitigate them. This idea, however, that private investors need advice from the federal government on how to invest and what they should demand companies disclose, is dubious to say the least. Nevertheless, in Canada too, the federal government has shown significant enthusiasm for mandating climate disclosures. Last year, a loan program to help large employers survive the COVID lockdowns required recipient companies ""to publish annual climate-related financial disclosure reports, including how their future operations will support environmental sustainability and national climate goals."" With the more than $100 billion expropriated from Canadian taxpayers to fund federal climate spending since 2015 apparently insufficient, the Trudeau government is bent on conscripting private capital through regulation as well to bolster its ammunition in the climate wars. The goal, it should be clear, has nothing to do with improving financial markets and everything to do with raising public alarm about climate change. Indeed, if the goal is to improve investment decisions through corporate risk disclosure mandates, it's odd that Ottawa would elevate climate change above any number of greater risks - the possibilities of world war, riots and political unrest, cyberattacks, epidemics and so on. We could also add to the list of risks greater than climate change itself, the risk of activist politicians imposing economically destructive policies to deal with climate change. Both Joe Biden and Justin Trudeau are committed to emissions targets with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C, but as economists Robert P. Murphy and Ross McKitrick reported in a recent Fraser Institute paper, this goal comes with significant economic costs and ""did not arise from the economics literature or from formal cost-benefit analysis."" The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) admitted in its 2018 report, Murphy and McKitrick note, that policies for achieving the 1.5C target would only be justified if the environmental damages of carbon emissions in 2030 ranges from $135 to $5,500 per tonne - or about two to 89 times what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated earlier this year. Murphy and McKitrick also cited the work of economist William Nordhaus, who was awarded the Nobel prize for his work analyzing the long-term economic effects of climate change and climate policies. According to Nordhaus's 2016 modelling work, achieving the 1.5C target would probably be so economically destructive that people would be better off if governments did nothing about climate change. If governments are really convinced that companies should be forced to make disclosures on the financial risks of climate change, it would make more sense to have the companies disclose how they plan to deal with the risks posed by economically destructive federal climate policies than the risks posed by climate change itself. The former, after all, is likely a greater financial risk to most companies than the latter. Matthew Lau is an adjunct scholar with the Fraser Institute.

"Opinion: Provinces, feds need to cooperate on paid sick leave plan",https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-provinces-feds-need-to-cooperate-on-paid-sick-leave-plan,leaderpost.com,"All governments should collaborate and Ottawa needs to provide better funding and simplicity, writes Charles S. Shaver.",['Dr. Charles S. Shaver'],2021-06-02 00:00:00,"Getty Images ""This premier too has a chance to change his ways. He has a chance to save lives."" - NDP Leader Ryan Meili He was referring to Premier Scott Moe's refusal to provide enhanced paid sick leave. In mid-April, Minister of Labour Don Morgan elaborated that he was not planning to mandate paid sick days : ""It's not done anywhere in Canada that I'm aware of. We think it would be an unnecessary imposition."" Can Saskatchewan avoid the dire situation in Manitoba ? With a positivity rate of 12.3 per cent (13.6 per cent in Winnipeg) earlier this week, it has the highest rate of new COVID-19 cases in North America. Not surprisingly, Winnipeg recently recorded 72 clusters of cases associated with workplaces. Manitoba has transferred over 30 patients to hospitals in Ontario and Saskatchewan. It asked for assistance from the Canadian Armed Forces, and also requested surplus vaccine doses from the United States. Meanwhile, Saskatchewan, B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec have announced reopening plans . Case counts across Canada are down more than 50 per cent since mid-April. About half of Canadians have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Some two-thirds of those over age 18 in Saskatchewan have received their first dose of vaccine; the number in hospital due to COVID-19 is the lowest since late November. Yet one can never let down one's guard. Consider the recent unexpected surges in cases in Vietnam, Taiwan and Singapore. If periods of lockdowns are to be shortened and recurrent waves of this and any future pandemics avoided, the premiers must use all the potential tools in their toolboxes. This requires increased rapid testing and contact tracing, adequate paid sick benefits, greatly enhanced temporary funding from Ottawa and much better federal-provincial cooperation - not the current patchwork of plans. Prior to the pandemic, only two provinces mandated paid sick leave: in Quebec, two paid sick days per year and in Prince Edward Island one day. Ontario used to require two days, but this was repealed by Premier Doug Ford in 2018. New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador still provide no paid sick benefits. Quebec is the only province with paid family leave and which provides a financial benefit of $575 per week to workers forced to isolate because they have COVID-19 or have been in contact with a positive case. PEI has a temporary fund which reimburses employers or self-employed persons up to $160 per day for six days to attend a vaccination, for testing, illness, or self-isolation. For many months, Premiers Doug Ford and Jason Kenney argued that the problems were a poor supply of vaccines and a lack of border controls - both due to the federal government. They were only partly correct, and ignored the problem of workplace infection, over which they do have some control. For months, Ford had refused to consider provincial sick leave, but relied on the federal Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit. However, the CRSB pays only $450 per week after taxes (less than minimum wage), persons must apply every week, it does not cover shorter leave times, and remittance may take several weeks. As the CRSB was not improved in the new federal budget, Ontario announced that it would finally consider a supplemental provincial program. It initially proposed to double the CRSB to $1,000 per week before taxes, and cover 100 per cent of the increased cost but Ottawa balked. Ford then provided three paid sick days. Businesses would pay up to $200 per day, and be reimbursed by the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board. In early May, Manitoba announced a program that would provide employers with up to $600 per employee for up to five days. British Columbia then agreed to reimburse employers up to $200 per day for three days. Shortly thereafter, Nova Scotia initiated a plan that would cover businesses and the self-employed, and pay up to $160 per day for four days. The Yukon now pays $378 daily up to 10 days. In Alberta, the government will cover three hours of paid leave when persons are vaccinated, and self-isolation support with room, board and a payment of $625, for a total value of $2,000. However, in all provinces, sick employees when needing 10-14 days off would also have to apply for the federal CRSB, with all its faults. Thus, obtaining access to adequate paid sick leave would be overly complicated across Canada. All governments should collaborate and Ottawa needs to provide better funding and simplicity. Isolating workers would continue to be paid through their employer, who would be reimbursed by the provincial government, which would eventually be paid by Ottawa. Scott Moe and the other premiers should mandate sufficient paid sick leave for all workers. Ottawa should immediately agree to reimburse provinces and territories for funding businesses and the self-employed for this leave. It should also pay provinces and territories to provide adequate sick benefits to MDs, nurses, and other health professionals, especially while they are awaiting to be fully vaccinated.

We need mandatory masks laws Postmedia Mandatory public masking has been saving lives and leading to an earlier (and safer) reopening of societies around the world. Despite this, Canadian officials have been reticent to support this cheap, effective measure. As of May 12, 13 U.S. states, including Illinois, New York and Massachusetts, and 84 countries, including Israel, Germany, Austria, Czechia and France, have laws mandating public masking. And zero Canadian jurisdictions. Opinion: Want to save lives and the economy? We need mandatory masks laws We are emerging from a severe lockdown, taking tentative steps into the unknown. Over a period of seven weeks, Canadians have endured the challenges of physical isolation. The pressure to reopen society is immense, but many share our concern that reopening will cause a second wave of cases. Advice for hand hygiene and physical distancing has been widely adopted and accepted. Why not masks? Citing asymptomatic and presymptomatic spread, on April 6 Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief medical officer of health, stated ""wearing a non-medical mask … is an additional measure that you can take to protect others around you in situations where physical distancing is difficult."" This is hardly a rousing endorsement. Similar weak recommendations have come from other public health officials, like Dr. Bonnie Henry of B.C., and Dr. Deena Hinshaw of Alberta. Public health officials presumably aren't convinced that evidence is strong enough to make a stronger recommendation for universal wear. The gold standard of evidence in medicine is the randomized controlled trial, where two populations are randomly assigned the intervention, and then a measurement of the intervention's effectiveness is made. Unfortunately, this doesn't exist for a population-scale intervention like masking. So instead we need to rely on the best available evidence, and the precautionary principle. Michael Ryan of the WHO says: ""If you need to be right before you move, you will never win. Perfection is the enemy of the good when it comes to emergency management."" As we learn more about asymptomatic spread, superspreader events, droplet transmission and the utility of masks as barriers, it is evident that masks play an important role. Countries with mandatory mask laws have seen their curves bend towards zero, contrary to countries with voluntary recommendations such as Canada, the U.K. and the U.S. There are exceptions, such as Iceland, Australia and New Zealand, which have successfully tamped down the curve without mandatory masks. Each has its own story, including massive testing, or extremely early lockdown. But these are few and far between. All of these layers, such as physical distancing, contact tracing, isolation, lockdowns, and masks, act to decrease the R0: the average number of people each viral-shedding person infects. Above 1? The infection grows in a population. Below 1? It shrinks. Scientists believe it could be up to 5.7 in a population without any mitigation measures. A recent scientific paper looked at how the combination of a mask's effectiveness and the proportion of a population wearing it worked to decrease the R0. If the mask is only moderately effective, as in cloth masks, the proportion wearing it needs to be high. For example, a cloth mask, which may only be 60 per cent effective, requires 60 per cent compliance to drop the Ro below one. In a recent poll, abysmally only 33 per cent of Canadians are wearing masks, Quebec being the worst at 24 per cent. Like many previous public health measures such as seatbelts, or bicycle helmets, compliance is poor until legislated. Similarly, if we want people to wear masks, we need them to be mandatory. Another advantage to masks, aside from saving lives, is reopening the economy. South Korea, Czechia, Austria, China are all countries with mandatory or high levels of mask compliance that have enabled their economies to open up, with minimal increases in COVID mortality. A recent economic analysis of mask use estimated a value of $3,000 to $6,000 to the economy for each mask worn. Possible harm? Literally billions of people are masking in 79 countries around the world without worsening their COVID-19 numbers - good evidence of minimal risk. Multiple provinces are starting to open up their economies. Quebec and Ontario are still in the throes of severe outbreaks. In both situations, mandatory masking will help save lives and prevent a recurrence, providing a massive return on investment. I protect you, you protect me. We all protect society.

Opinion: Let workers stay home with pay when they’re sick,https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-let-workers-stay-home-with-pay-when-theyre-sick,leaderpost.com,"By raising the floor and mandating paid sick leave, we can help stop this pandemic, and keep everyone safer, writes Gavin McGarrigle.",['Tim Switzer'],2021-03-29 00:00:00,"The refrain ""if you're sick, stay home"" is not just smart workplace policy, it's also smart public health policy. Of course, COVID-19 has elevated the importance of this approach to new levels. Preventing the spread of COVID-19 in workplaces is a matter of life and death. This month the premier acknowledged the link between provincial workplace policies and public health by legislating paid time off for workers to get the vaccine. It's time to take the next step and legislate employer-paid sick leave for all Saskatchewan's workers. If you already have paid sick leave - you're in the minority. Most workers in Saskatchewan do not have paid sick day benefits. Among low-paid workers, that figure rises even higher. It should also be no surprise that more women than men don't have paid sick leave. The fact is COVID-19 lockdowns and stay-at-home orders do not work without paid sick leave. While the federal government's Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit is, at least in theory, helping workers with COVID symptoms stay home, it is temporary, insufficient and inconvenient. To qualify, a worker must miss a full week of work. It only provides a mere $450 per week to people who have had to miss work due to COVID-19. It does not provide the same security that paid sick leave would, as processing delays of up to four weeks is too late for many workers living paycheque to paycheque. Workers who can't afford to take a massive pay cut are still forced to make a choice between a paycheque or going to work and infecting others. When someone decides to stay home because they have a runny nose or a new cough, it's not to benefit their health, it's for the rest of us. Why should they have to pay?"
Opinion: Politics still driving COVID-19 response,https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-politics-still-driving-covid-19-response,leaderpost.com,"Saskatchewan remains on the verge of a surge because decision-makers seem inclined to wishful thinking, writes Jim Harding.",['Jim Harding'],2020-11-25 00:00:00,"Photo by BRANDON HARDER / Regina Leader-Post Announcing a few restrictions, Saskatchewan's health minister, Paul Merriman, claimed he was taking a ""measured approach."" It sounded more like ""half measures."" Requiring masks for only 65 per cent left us all vulnerable. Hasn't the government been carefully ""measuring"" Saskatchewan's rate of active cases surpassing Ontario and B.C.? Being halfway to Manitoba's 13 per cent positivity? Saskatoon's ICUs already being stretched? All the warning signs of another killer spread in long term care? After mounting pressure, the province has seen some light, requiring masks in indoor public places across Saskatchewan. When the health minister received the letter from 300 doctors, urging immediate action, he politely said he'd ""follow public health advice."" Yet when chief medical health officer Dr. Saqib Shahab speaks about continuing the piecemeal approach, he gives vague, politicized answers; pep talks. We can't keep hiding behind opinion and jurisdiction. Genetic vaccines will not be a magic bullet and it may take a year to see how effective they are overall. A federally co-ordinated plan is long overdue. Some still say we should wait for this pandemic to end to evaluate our shortcomings. Nonsense. Some advisors stubbornly believed the threat would be a new influenza, not a more contagious SARS. Decision-makers didn't ask probing questions. Multi-disciplinary teams, to guide decisive action, were not quickly put in place. Countries, like Canada, were caught with a chronic lack of PPE and testing capacity. And Canada's hospital capacity has steadily declined. There was only fleeting capacity to create integrated policies. Mixed messaging laid more ground for conspiracy ""theories."" The mass media reported aggregate numbers without meaningful context. It is not surprising that we remain without sufficient public health understanding or compliance. And ignoring these shortcomings sets us up to repeat them. Saskatchewan has been steadily falling into the same trap as Manitoba, as well as North Dakota, where proactive ""public health"" actions such as universal mask usage, were sidelined, supposedly to avoid economic impact and/or political backlash. This has been self-defeating; both now face lockdowns. Testing and tracking only work if other measures like mask usage are firmly in place. Opening schools is fine, but as Quebec shows, this is only viable if community spread is under control. Disruptive school closures may soon return. Political leaders like Alberta Premier Jason Kenney continually emphasize minimizing ""impairment"" to the economy. Fearing lockdowns, they fail to give uniform messaging. This continues regarding sizes of gatherings. They are not solely to blame. In July, the WHO issued an advisory that this virus was airborne. Why did it take until now to get reliable information about safe masks being three-layered? Early false messaging flew in the face of best practices in several Asian countries. This was probably rationalized to crisis manage scarcity of PPE for hospitals. We need to ""do unto others"" for the Golden Rule to work in public health. And we don't only wear masks to protect others; we wear them to protect ourselves. You can't expect different results if you don't embrace different practices. Since June, Canada's death rate has risen from 20 to 30 people per 100,000; eight times Australia's rate. South Korea, where universal mask use and effective testing and tracking has helped control surges and avert reactive lockdowns, is still under one (yes one). Saskatchewan remains on the verge of a surge because decision-makers seem inclined to wishful thinking and ""advisers"" are still reading political lips. Premier Moe calling this a ""slowdown"" just adds to the confusion. This is not a way forward. Nor are anti-mask protests. Informed health officials are again saying ""stay home, socialize only with your household""? Better late than never will not protect healthcare and precarious workers, seniors, young adults at growing risk, or small businesses who remain pawns in the fools-game.

Opinion: Governments' parochial path leading us into Delta collision,https://leaderpost.com/opinion/opinion-governments-parochial-path-leading-us-into-collision-with-delta-variant,leaderpost.com,"An integrated approach that recognizes local problems have global dimensions has to quickly become the order of the day, writes Jim Harding.",['Jim Harding'],2021-08-12 00:00:00,"Opinion: Governments' parochial path leading us into collision with Delta variant Opinion: Governments' parochial path leading us into collision with Delta variant Photo by Maksim Tkachenko / Getty Images Calgary had the good sense to require proof of vaccination or on-site rapid testing when they reopened the Stampede's live music venue. Manitoba had the good sense to require full vaccination of people over 12 to see the Blue Bombers. Ontario also seems to be learning, requiring masks for students returning to school. And Quebec is leading the way with vaccine passports. But not here. Saskatchewan opened the floodgates, allowing 33,000 to gather, without precaution, for a Roughriders game. Will Rider Nation be a super-spreader? Opinion: Governments' parochial path leading us into collision with Delta variant We know where most Canadians stand. A recent Nanos poll shows that people want reassurances when we go into public spaces as nearly 80 per cent support denying the unvaccinated access to things like sporting events or indoor dining. The Saskatchewan government has consistently taken a short-sighted, parochial path. It was slow to mandate masks and, initially, took the utterly silly position that rural people could be excluded. It resisted restrictions on workplaces, shopping and entertainment. It fell into the trap that backfired in England and Sweden, making lockdowns more likely, by not taking precautions to keep infections low enough to allow testing and tracing. Saskatchewan has now also lifted some quarantine requirements. Ignoring the epidemiology, it has naively seen vaccination as a technological fix. Premier Scott Moe even referred positively to England's quick opening up, with their vaccination rate rising , without seeming to grasp that the Delta variant was already taking over. His officials should be checking the John Hopkins COVID mortality database. Boris Johnson's U.K. has the highest death rate, of 195 per 100,000, of any G7 country. It has more than twice the death rate of Canada (71) and is even higher than the U.S. (188), which, largely due to parochial, nationalistic and yes, lying of Trump, has seen nearly 620,000 deaths. We see where the parochial, libertarian views take us in Republican-controlled states like Florida, Texas and Louisiana, where laissez-faire approaches fuel a deadly fourth wave. Even as the older population, previously so at risk, gets more protection, mutations make the Delta variant more dangerous to young people. Almost one-fifth of recent U.S. infections have been among children. The vast majority of people hospitalized and dying are from the unvaccinated, but a small number of fully vaccinated can still get infected and/or be carriers. Some vaccinated people remain quite vulnerable. This shows why the majority have a right to know about their risks in public spaces. We felt relatively safe going into a store with everyone wearing a mask. Now none of us know who hasn't been vaccinated when we enter mask-free public spaces. Western provinces are presently leading Canada's rising rate in COVID cases . It was asinine to abandon indoor masking with the signs of a fourth wave. A democracy must always protect the rights of minorities, including political minorities. However, rule by the political minority is not acceptable. Nor is it acceptable for political leaders to appease minorities even if this population is critical to their re-election in our easily fragmented, first-past-the-post electoral system. It is disconcerting for Premier Moe to act as a head of state and compare us with another country, as justification for his lackadaisical approaches. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney is also resorting to this. This shows just how balkanized partisan politics has become, especially, it seems, among provinces that stubbornly cling to high carbon economies. And there is an underlying ideology that relies on parochialism doesn't stand up. Rights always imply responsibilities. In spite of decades of neo-liberalism, we still live in a Commons. The water crisis catching up with us, the droughts, heat waves and toxic smoke from the mega-wildfires spreading across the boreal, are becoming interconnected with the pandemic in our everyday lives. Since the murder of George Floyd, ""I can't breathe"" is taking on many meanings, not only for COVID patients on respirators but for people forced to breath toxic air. It certainly is ""code red"" for humanity. Parochialism has run its course. An integrated approach that recognizes that local problems have global dimensions, from public health and environmental protection to economic development, has to quickly become the order of the day.

This drop is the largest that Statistics Canada has announced since they started reporting these numbers in 1961. Much of this damage has been borne by small- and medium-sized businesses. The retail and travel industries have been particularly hard hit. If the current trend continues, these businesses will lose much more. What is the federal government doing? A 75-per-cent wage subsidy has been promised, but the details haven't been released. Businesses that qualify will have to apply for it every month through a web portal which has yet to be constructed. If everything goes as planned, a business can expect to start receiving money in three to six weeks. But what if everything doesn't go to plan? Canada has been in lockdown since March. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said: ""30 per cent of small firms say they can survive less than a month in the current situation."" It's been a month already, and in that time thousands of businesses have folded. The government has offered $40,000 loans for small businesses but only for non-deferrable expenses and only through existing financial institutions. Credit unions, which many Alberta businesses use for banking, were not eligible to offer these loans. New clients aren't eligible to receive these loans, so if a business switches from a credit union to one of the big banks to receive this help, they won't be eligible there either. As well, many business owners don't qualify for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) help because of how their payroll is structured or due to the minimum payroll required to qualify. Numerous business owners have written me to ask for help navigating through this program, which has changed several times since first announced last month. The details that have been made available are scarce and I have been told that the resulting uncertainty has led to banks being reluctant to issue the loans. In comparison, the Small Business Administration in the United States has paid out more than 220,000 similar loans to businesses already. The bottom line is that we were told, in just a matter of weeks, the government would be able to create and start providing help for businesses. At the same time, the government has also said the first cheques from this program won't be issued until at least May, by which point many businesses will have permanently closed. Canada can and must do better. We have proposed that all goods and services taxes remitted in the last 12 months be refunded. Small businesses that are run by owner-operators should be eligible for the wage subsidy. Businesses should have immediate access to loans that can help them bridge the gap between their current payroll needs and the arrival of the funds they have been promised. These measures would be a welcome beginning to a more comprehensive relief solution than the government has currently proposed. Above all, the government must be clear and transparent with Canadians. Canadian businesses need certainty that there is help available to them and that it will come, sooner rather than later. Matt Jeneroux is member of Parliament for Edmonton Riverbend.

It is no surprise, given the immense changes in the structure of our lives that most people have felt some level of increased mental health challenges. The Mental Health Research Canada 4th National Report has indicated that anxiety and depression are at their highest since the pandemic started, reporting that four times the number of Canadians are experiencing high anxiety levels, and the rates of depression have more than doubled since the start of the pandemic. Historically, Indigenous peoples experience a much higher rate of mental health challenges. Stats Canada reports that the discrepancies between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples and health have long been reported, noting that we continue to see the effects of intergenerational trauma from Indian Residential Schools in Indigenous communities. The report notes that food and job insecurity, poverty, and unemployment all play a role in mental health challenges that Indigenous peoples continue to face. In 2015, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) outlined the ongoing health disparities that Indigenous peoples continue to experience as a result of colonization, and laid out 94 calls to action to redress the harms caused by this system. The report indicated that, for many Indigenous people, there was a direct path from residential school to prison, many seeing the prison system, as a continuation of the Indian Residential School System . The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health states that prisoners are four to seven times more likely to suffer from a mental illness. More importantly, they note that poverty, abuse, growing up in broken homes, and addictions are determining factors in mental health challenges. For Indigenous people, who make up the largest portion of those who are incarcerated in Canada, colonialism has not only created the conditions that lead to their criminalization through the Indian Residential School system, but continues to maintain the cycle of punishment and containment of Indigenous peoples through the penal system. Claims by Correctional Service Canada ( CSC) that prisons include culturally relevant and responsive supports and programming, and the RCMP claiming reconciliation efforts, have done little to affect the criminalization of Indigenous peoples, as we have continued to see an increase in the mass incarceration of Indigenous peoples from 2015 , when the TRC report was released. This increase indicates what many people are starting to realize, that the prison system does not protect and keep people safe. Instead, it perpetuates a cycle of violence and inequity that has exacerbated the mental health challenges faced by Indigenous people, and indeed all those who have been incarcerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Covid-19 pandemic has intensified the already inhumane conditions inside prisons, with reports of prisoners being on strict lockdowns for almost entire days . Since the start of the pandemic, many prisoners have been forced to go without the support and connection of loved ones as almost all federal Institutions and all Alberta correctional institutions continue to not allow any in-person visitations. The lockdowns, limited PPE, inability to social distance, inadequate nutrition, and no access to mental health supports have been at the centre of multiple prisoner hunger strikes across Canada. Those of us on the outside, who recognize the harms of the penal system are working together to end this cycle of violence for Indigenous peoples, and all those who experience the harms of this system. There are individuals and communities across Canada, who are actively working towards creating new systems of care. We are all committed to working towards a new kind of safety, and accountability for all of our communities. Karrie Auger is a community organizer and member of Free Lands Free Peoples.

Opinion: Testing is the key to reviving travel and tourism,https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/opinion-testing-is-the-key-to-reviving-travel-and-tourism,montrealgazette.com,"A pilot project in Alberta allows certain incoming travellers, including international visitors, to quarantine for only 48 hours.",['Sandy White'],2020-11-03 00:00:00,"Photo by JONATHAN HAYWARD / THE CANADIAN PRESS As we navigate the COVID-19 crisis, Canada has mishandled the safe reopening of our country to domestic and international air travel. That may be about to change. This week, in partnership with the federal government, Alberta began a pilot project that allows incoming travellers, including international visitors, to quarantine for only 48 hours. It is based on science and testing, an approach the entire country appears to have thus far ignored. Under the plan, travellers can get tested upon their arrival in Alberta and will have to isolate for two days if the test is negative, instead of the 14 days now generally required upon entry to Canada. To confirm they are COVID-free, they will be tested again six or seven days later and have to remain in Alberta for 14 days. For now, this option is only available to people arriving at Calgary airport and one land border crossing. If Alberta's approach is successful, it will be a victory for science and reason and should lead to Canada reopening nation-wide to international travel, the lack of which has devastated our economy and the lives of millions of Canadians. Travel and tourism represent roughly two per cent of GDP and four per cent of Canadian jobs. Yet since March, our borders have remained largely closed. Even within Canada, the ""Atlantic bubble"" is almost entirely off limits to domestic travel, making Canada one of the few countries continuing to limit internal movement. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), based in Montreal, ironically, said that if Canada doesn't ease its Draconian travel restrictions, it estimates that about 410,000 jobs and some $39 billion of Canada's GDP will be at risk. It doesn't have to be this way. Alberta's initiative follows numerous countries that recognize severe travel restrictions as unnecessary and that have enacted sensible policies allowing people to move inside and beyond their borders with relative freedom. A recent report by the United Nations World Tourism Organization showed that, of countries with advanced economies, 79 per cent have loosened restrictions. In Germany, which drastically outperforms Canada in deaths and cases per million, testing at airports has been in place for months. Results are available in hours and a negative test allows people to avoid Germany's 10-day quarantine, which is only required for travellers coming from a ""risk area."" South Korea, New Zealand and others that have managed the pandemic better than Canada have implemented similar testing policies. Federal Transport Minister Marc Garneau says the government is protecting against travel-related COVID-19 cases, employing such measures as ""screening questions, temperature measurements, the fact that they must wear masks."" Yet nearly six months after our peers have done so, Canada still does not have an adequate testing system in place. While there is reticence about opening our borders, much of this fear is misplaced, and a rigorous testing regime can help assuage these concerns. A recent report by IATA found that only 44 cases of COVID-19 have resulted from air travel globally in 2020, while airlines have carried 1.2 billion passengers. To open safely, Canada should require visitors to show a negative test before they travel here, and follow the Alberta pilot project model of shorter quarantines and multiple tests upon arrival. The coronavirus is serious and we should be taking all reasonable precautions. However, as we learn more every day, we should understand that an overreaction now doesn't make up for Canada's lack of action in the past.

Looking to buy a car soon? Auto sales are in for a bumpy ride as coronavirus spreads,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/drive/mobility/article-looking-to-buy-a-car-soon-auto-sales-are-in-for-a-bumpy-ride-as/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"Opinions are mixed and divided by country on how the coronavirus outbreak will affect production and parts suppliers, and when factories will be up and running",['Mark Richardson'],2020-03-13 05:00:00,"The COVID-19 pandemic is now everywhere, moving more rapidly than most in North America imagined. Who knows where it's all headed? Large gatherings are cancelled and workers are encouraged to stay home, some in self-quarantine. It's not so simple for workers in assembly plants to stay home, however, and nor for salespeople and technicians at auto dealerships. If those hands-on people want to continue to make money, despite government assurances of financial assistance, they have to be there on the shop floor, masks and sanitizer within reach. The only solution may be a forced closure of the entire facility. This happened a week ago in Windsor, where the FCA minivan plant stopped production of the Chrysler Pacifica for 24 hours after unionized workers walked out, concerned for their health after a co-worker self-quarantined. In Europe, Renault, Peugeot, Ford and Volkswagen, among others, have shut down auto assembly plants for the foreseeable future. In Italy, non-essential businesses are ordered closed, and of course that includes car dealerships. We've not seen such a ripple of closures in North America yet, but it may well happen soon and it doesn't bode well for either auto production or sales. All businesses will say their decision to close will be made in the interest of public health and safety, but it will really come down to supply and demand. Both General Motors and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said this month that their U.S. production has not been affected, and GM's CEO Mary Barra said earlier in March that parts supplies are assured ""quite far into this month"" - an optimistic translation of that statement suggests only another week or so, however, compared to the usual one or two months. Parts production is being restored slowly in Central China, but these production lines need their own suppliers; this does not happen overnight. ""Even if we wanted to resume production, we can't access the materials we need due to supply chain disruptions,"" a spokesperson for a Japanese auto supply company with plants in four Central Chinese cities told Reuters. ""On top of that, we're facing staffing shortages at our plants."" Ontario-based Magna International, the world's third largest manufacturer of auto parts, said Sunday that production has resumed at most of its 54 plants in China, though not yet to full capacity. And parts maker Martinrea International Inc., also based in Ontario, said this month that shifting dependence to locally manufactured parts, even at potentially higher cost, could be a good thing. ""Longer term, I believe the coronavirus event coupled with the trade disputes we have seen may cause all of us to review our supply chains,"" said Rob Wildeboer, executive chair of Martinrea, on a quarterly conference call with investors March 5. ""For example, I think this will add to a trend to local insourcing or restoring to North America, which frankly could be very good for us."" In Mexico, however, a government minister admitted that some auto assembly plants have enough inventory only for this month. Unlike Barra, he thought this was a major concern. ""I've been in contact with some important companies,"" Manuel Gonzalez told Reuters. He's the economic development minister for Aguascalientes, one of a dozen Mexican states that produce cars, of which 80 per cent go to the United States and Canada. ""If that supply is not normalized, we will probably see firms suspending production."" Even if the supply is restored, however, the buyers may not be there. Last week, Morgan Stanley said in an investor note that it expects U.S. auto sales to drop by 9 per cent this year, compared to the 1-2 per cent it originally forecast. That's a drop of a million new vehicles from its initial estimate of 16.5 million vehicles to be sold in 2020. It won't be just new cars affected, either, thanks to what Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas called the ""demand shock"" of COVID-19. ""Lower consumer sentiment will mean consumers may put off the purchase of expensive consumer discretionary purchases such as a ~$35k new car,"" wrote Jonas to justify his prediction. Research company LMC Automotive is not quite so gloomy, saying that U.S. sales will probably only drop an additional 300,000 this year, but its current forecast for the world as a whole is still not optimistic, dropping about 4 per cent for all auto sales. After all, sales in China plummeted almost 80 per cent in February, where whole cities have been on lockdown. ""Forecasts for car markets are likely to be revised down as the public health crisis deepens - especially in Europe and North America,"" says David Leggett, Automotive Editor for analytics company GlobalData. ""If the global vehicle market decline in 2020 is nearer 10 per cent, that will inevitably result in much lower earnings for automotive companies, many of whom are experiencing rising cost pressures formed by the necessity to invest in expensive technologies such as electrification. Indeed, the new stronger headwinds on the global car market come as they face the burden of much tighter regulatory hurdles on CO2, especially in Europe."" There is one sign of hope, however. Gas prices are significantly down, now averaging 82 cents a litre in southern Ontario. With people avoiding the congestion of public transport, and perhaps less frugal with using their cars, maybe we'll all rediscover the joy of driving. After all, what goes around, comes around.

Opinion: Outpouring of love for Montreal restaurants turns to disrespect,https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/opinion-outpouring-of-love-for-montreal-restaurants-turns-to-disrespect,montrealgazette.com,"Looking at a table left empty by no-shows, I understood why many popular independent restaurants are either closing or on their last legs.",['David Ferguson'],2021-11-11 00:00:00,"Photo by Allen McInnis / Montreal Gazette On a recent Saturday, as I stood staring at an empty table No. 6 - a table for four whose occupants had confirmed only three hours prior ""we will be there, no doubt!"" - I understood that the love was gone, and why many popular independent restaurants are either closing or on their last legs. The lockdown brought out the ""restaurant-love."" Social media overflowed with enough heartbreaking comments about lost small, intimate restos to fill a bleak Russian novel. The first few weeks of ""the great return"" brought forth that love, and it was felt. But now, the odes are more like haikus. Before I go off on my rant, let me assure you, 90 per cent of clients are great. Then there are the 10 per cent, the killjoys who arrive 45 minutes late and ask for an off-the-menu tomato salad (when the trees have already shed their fall bloom). Worse still are the ones who don't even show up. Whereas a no-show for a corporate restaurant is a cold statistic, for an indie restaurant it's personal, like an expression of contempt toward the house and its employees (empty tables generally do not tip well). When we reach out to the absent guests, we find ourselves ghosted like a teenage prom date, the corsage in a waste bin. All the departments of a corporate restaurant are in one indie-restaurateur's head. We hunt for new employees while dousing the flames of burnt-out staff. We make orders and receive goods, contact the bank over a potential NSF cheque, run to the SAQ only to find no tequila (yes, it happened; zero, nothing, nada). We try to bring new ideas to the table (literally), while still maintaining quality control. All for an empty table No. 6 and a broken promise. Tables are real estate for a restaurant; they must be filled twice a night for the business to stay healthy while maintaining low menu prices. Turning a table is oxygen for the industry. So please do not be critical when we ask ""early or late"" as we take your reservation, or insist on 7 p.m., which is not sustainable for us. And if you do agree to leave before the second service, please do not linger. The basic laws of physics prevent us from seating two people in the same spot. Lingering creates a traffic jam that would make even a Montreal construction-cone-infested road blush. Some may say, ""Gus, if you can't handle the heat get out of the kitchen!"" Perhaps I will one day, but I ask you, who will descend into that inferno after we leave? The present staffing crisis for the service industry is a future cheffing crisis. Many of us fell in love with restaurants as dishwashers and bussers, tasting the adrenaline rush and seeing miraculous foods for the first time. Enrolment is down in cooking schools. Moreover, smart young chefs are opening hybrid quick-service restaurants, with low staffing needs and equipped for UberEats, rather than full-service restaurants. This provides fewer opportunities for future chefs to be trained to operate and own a full-service restaurant. ""Gus, I hear ya, but what happened to the customer is always right?"" Yes, but it doesn't mean the restaurant is always wrong. The client and owner both love restaurants, so we must work together to respect and support them so they can survive. The pandemic taught both owners and clients that full-service restaurants are not essential. Life goes on. Many chefs themselves got off the hamster wheel. We know you love our restaurants, and we are grateful for that. But when something is loved without being respected, it is akin to a toy. Restaurants are not toys to the owners, chefs and servers, they our workplace and our livelihoods. So please treat them more than just a toy, or one day we may lose them.

Opinion: Pandemic's impact on mental health might surprise us,https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/opinion-pandemics-impact-on-mental-health-might-surprise-us,montrealgazette.com,"To be sure, there have been serious effects for some, but apocalyptic visions of a looming mental health crisis may be erroneously alarmist.",['Rob Whitley'],2020-08-08 00:00:00,"Photo by John Mahoney / Montreal Gazette The last months have been filled with bleak predictions about mental health in Canada due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These predictions have been couched in apocalyptic language, with much talk of a looming ""mental health crisis,"" ""depression time-bomb"" or even an ""epidemic of suicide."" Such forecasts predict an imminent mental health disaster across Canada, with worse consequences than the coronavirus pandemic itself. But are such dystopian visions based on scientific evidence, or sensational scaremongering? A just released Leger survey of more than 1,500 adult Canadians give some preliminary answers. This survey found that only 16 per cent of Canadians rate their mental health as ""bad"" or ""very bad"" since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. In other words, the vast majority rate their mental health as ""good,"" ""very good"" or ""excellent,""despite rising concerns about a second wave and further lockdowns. These findings are consistent with pre-existing research indicating that socio-economic crises can (counter-intuitively) actually promote mental health. For example, the phrase ""Blitz spirit"" is well-known in the United Kingdom, referring to a semi-mythical period of the Second World War, where Londoners rallied together with resolution and defiance to resist the ravages of nightly Luftwaffe air-raids. This ""Blitz spirit"" is epitomized in a famous British wartime poster Keep Calm and Carry On. While some have questioned the reality of the ""Blitz spirit,"" research shows that psychiatric admissions actually decreased during the Blitz. Moreover, a network of psychiatric clinics that were set up to cater for the expected mental health casualties of the Blitz were closed due to a lack of patients, indicating that the Luftwaffe raids did not trigger an epidemic of mental illness. More recently, a large-scale European study surprisingly found an overall decrease in depressive symptoms after the Global Financial Crisis across 19 of the 21 countries studied (Spain and Cyprus being the exceptions). These findings imply that the repercussions of the Global Financial Crisis were not uniformly negative, and that doomsday predictions about an impending mental health crisis due to COVID-19 may not be warranted. These findings raise the question: What factors promote mental health during a socio-economic crisis such as COVID-19? The existing research points to some surprising answers. First, work is a source of purpose and meaning for most people, but can also engender significant amounts of stress. The ""work from home"" directives associated with COVID-19 will have provided a welcome break from a stressful work environment for many, as well as less time commuting and more quality time with immediate family, all of which has been linked to positive mental health. Second, research indicates that people tend to cut back on unhealthy habits such as smoking, drinking and junk food during socio-economic crises, often as a cost-cutting measure. Contrariwise, people are more likely to exercise outdoors and obtain adequate sleep due to reduced traffic, which can also mean less pollution and fewer accidents. All this can improve physical health, which is inextricably linked to mental health. Third, crises such as COVID-19 can engender their own type of ""Blitz spirit,"" uniting people in a collective experience and common cause. Indeed, a Hong Kong study found that the SARS crisis engendered widespread increases in social support from family and friends, as well as increased attention to mental health issues per se across society. To be sure, COVID-19 has created considerable anxiety and insecurity across Canada, and support and resources should be available for those in need. But apocalyptic visions of a looming mental health crisis may be erroneously alarmist. For some, the ongoing crisis will cause mental health woes, particularly the newly unemployed and those in financial difficulties. But for others, it may provide a much-needed breathing space and an opportunity to rethink priorities.

The events were sparsely attended and they brought out a collection of individuals with a grab bag of grievances. Some people did offer reasonable opinions critiquing specific COVID-19 rules. Canada certainly had some bizarre enforcement around that time, like the story of a by-law officer who paid a visit to an Ottawa father who was playing alone with his autistic son in an empty park. But the protests also brought out quite a few individuals whose main criticism was to call the whole pandemic a hoax and offer elaborate conspiracy theories. That was in the spring. Then, as the restrictions eased, the protests seemed to die down. Now, it appears they are flaring up again. But as the second wave of COVID-19 looks different from the first, it may be that a different crop of voices step forward to offer their dissent. As politicians and public health officials mull over returning the public to a second series of lockdowns, it's only inevitable people are going to step forward to offer their objections."
NORD: Lockdown scars are showing on Canadians,https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-lockdown-scars-are-showing-on-canadians,torontosun.com,On Friday Statistics Canada released the latest employment numbers. They weren’t good. But this shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone.,['Leah Nord'],2021-05-11 00:00:00,"Photo by Ernest Doroszuk / Postmedia Network Friday's numbers showed a drop of 207,000 jobs and nearly half a million Canadians who are now unemployed long-term as our labour market yo-yos between lockdowns and partial re-openings. Some parts of the economy are particularly hard hit, including retail, trade, culture and recreation, and personal services. The accommodation and food services sector alone accounted for 59,000 jobs lost in April. According to the StatsCan data, jobs in restaurants and hotels are still down by 30% compared to pre-COVID times and this group accounts for more than two-thirds of the overall lasting job losses caused by COVID-19. The plight of other hard hit sectors, such as travel, tourism, and aviation are well documented. We've become de-sensitized to the long-term impact each backtrack in employment truly has on Canadians because we've seen the economy partially rebound each time. But the rebounds we have seen are different than a truly sustainable recovery. Our collective focus is currently on the light at the end of the vaccine tunnel - which is genuinely hopeful - but today we risk losing sight of the continued turbulence in the labour market and what that means for the Canadians bearing the brunt of it. The blunt truth of our economic reality is we aren't all in this together. With the so-called ""K-shape"" recovery taking place, those on the bottom continue to face business restrictions, lockdowns, and lost jobs. Targeted support for those most impacted must be in place into 2022. The recent lockdowns will mean more permanent business closures. The job prospects for displaced workers grow slimmer with every month in lockdown as more businesses throw in the towel. Canada's entrepreneurs are tapped out and the longer restrictions continue, the worse the situation will become. At the same time, the third wave is also wreaking particular havoc on women and young Canadians. With school closures and summer break fast approaching, juggling childcare and work responsibilities will once more become a logistical and mental health burden that may very well lead to even more primary care givers, the majority of whom are women, involuntarily leaving the workforce. Students and young Canadians looking for summer and entry level jobs will also continue to struggle. Moving forward, restrictions must be fact-based. We must utilize every tool in our toolbox to keep Canadians safe and healthy - including aiding vaccine rollout, rapid screening programs, and continued best practices on distancing and PPE. Canadians also need a plan for what happens next. Other countries are announcing their reopening plans now because they understand businesses need lead time to prepare, especially in the travel sector. Yet Canada's strategy remains a mystery. The success or failure of our recovery will depend on what we do and how we plan now. The better we plan today, the more efficiently businesses can implement new procedures when the time comes, and the faster our recovery will be. But Canadians are still waiting. In the absence of a cohesive plan to help businesses jump-start the economy, the toll of this third lockdown is shining a light on the chasm between our temporary rebounds and durable, long-term recovery. The scars are showing in the labour market data - and on Canadians. - Leah Nord is Senior Director of Workforce Strategies and Inclusive Growth at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

Opinion on COVID-19: These epidemiologists say let’s think about reopening daycares and elementary schools,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-on-covid-19-we-are-epidemiologists-and-its-probably-safe-to-reopen-some-schools,nationalpost.com,"In contact tracing from China, Korea and elsewhere, epidemiologists have found few instances of children being part of a transmission chain","['Jay S. Kaufman', 'Joanna Merckx', 'National Post']",2020-04-22 00:00:00,"By Jay S. Kaufman and Joanna Merckx We are both epidemiologists, and one of us specializes in pediatric infectious diseases. Confined at home with our small children running amok, we are acutely aware of the impact on families of the lockdown to ""flatten the curve"" of the current pandemic. The characteristics and transmission dynamics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus (which causes the disease known as COVID-19) still remain largely unknown. But as new epidemiologic information does become available, it is important to reassess the complex social policies that were enacted to save lives, protect our health-care system and at the same time minimize collateral damage to families and civil society. Over 90 per cent of students worldwide have now been affected by pandemic-related school closures. A few countries are now cautiously reopening schools and others plan to do so in coming weeks. Ontario, meanwhile, has recently extended its closure, as have many U.S. states. As parents struggle to supervise and educate children at home and teachers are concerned for their workplace safety, we need to consider the important possibility that children may in fact play a limited role in passing the virus to others. Given their gregarious and unhygienic habits, children are often assumed to be important conduits of infectious disease. This is clearly true for influenza, which helps explain the common presumption that children ought to be important drivers of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well. In fact, there is little evidence this is so and plenty of reason to doubt it. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, a review of household transmission clusters found that a possible pediatric initial case was present in less than 10 per cent of investigated household clusters. This is in stark contrast to other epidemics, such as avian influenza, for which a child was the source of household infection more than half the time. Households are an especially good setting to study how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted because the contact between child and adult members is as close as it can get. Finding a very limited role for children in fuelling the transmission chain within the family suggests that school closures are probably not adding much in the containment of the epidemic. A literature review by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health found only one example for SARS-CoV-2 where a small child might have infected his parents. Photo by China Daily/Reuters A number of mathematical models of the COVID-19 epidemic also support the conjecture that transmission of the virus from children is rare or absent. In places where schools remained open, such as Iceland, there is no evidence they were important places of transmission. One detailed investigation of an infected nine-year-old boy in France did not detect a single secondary case after he had contact with 112 peers and adults at three different schools during his symptomatic period. The currently available literature , though still quite limited, therefore supports the theory that children pass on the infection rarely if at all. If it is true that children do not contribute importantly to the propagation of the epidemic, it's likely that school closures have a minimal impact on controlling the virus. But they do clearly have profound effects on the workforce and on the health of children and parents. Among other things, they exacerbate child obesity , household violence and intellectual setbacks for children missing out on educational content . Children with special needs are most severely affected. They are cut off from professional management and institutional resources, while school closure for children living in poor or marginalized households exacerbates existing inequalities . A number of models of the epidemic support the conjecture that transmission of the virus from children is rare or absent We must stress that when we refer to children we mean those of elementary-school age and younger. Though teens and adolescents have their own specific vulnerabilities and struggles with the limitations imposed by lockdowns, there is evidence that their role in transmission parallels that of adults . For children in high school and university, going back to school will be therefore be more complicated, potentially requiring greater use of physical distancing, hand hygiene and masks. The same holds true for inevitable social and professional interactions between parents and other adults in all school environments. If schools are open, teachers will commute to work and interact with each other, requiring additional hygiene and distancing measures to ensure their health and safety. SARS-CoV-2 has only circulated in human populations for a few months and much remains to be learned about its transmission and prevention. But already there is substantial reason to suspect that young children are not major contributors to the COVID-19 epidemic and may not need to be kept from school any longer. If we can allow a safe and carefully managed return, this would be a great relief to both children and parents.

Make the best choice always so we have time to get as many Saskatchewanians vaccinated as possible.""",['Alexander Wong'],2021-03-26 00:00:00,"Opinion: Province must come together to fight off a potential third wave Opinion: Province must come together to fight off a potential third wave Photo by BRANDON HARDER / Regina Leader-Post One year ago, I received an email from a colleague which contained a slide deck that had been presented internally to leadership within the Saskatchewan Health Authority. In the presentation, my friend and colleague Dr. Nathaniel Osgood presented modelling data that demonstrated the potential devastation that COVID-19 could wreak on our health-care system and our province at large. With visions of northern Italy and New York City fresh in my mind, I felt a horrible pit in my stomach. Was this the end of the world? What happened next were frantic efforts to mobilize immediate action. The need to lock down and eliminate close contact between persons, the need to rapidly expand our contact tracing and public health capacity, and to rapidly bolster our health-care system for the impending surge. The province shut down. We waited, and waited. Soon, it became evident that we would not be overwhelmed. There was a hopeful address given on April 22 hinting at reopening the province, slowly and methodically. I remember listening to Premier Moe's address, the first such address in Canada, and beaming with pride - yes, we did it, Saskatchewan! Opinion: Province must come together to fight off a potential third wave Once again in October and November, cases began to rise. I became worried and anxious watching our neighbours in Alberta reach the breaking point with their health-care system before slowdown measures were finally announced. We called for lockdown, for diligent attention by the public to the guidance from Dr. Saqib Shahab, and warned once again as cases rose dramatically in our vulnerable inner-city populations that we could be overwhelmed. The province slowed down, but did not shut down. We survived, albeit while suffering the highest per-capita rates of cases and deaths in Canada. A heavy cost to pay, but nonetheless, crisis was averted once again. Now, as Regina faces the highest proportion of variants of concern (VoCs) in Canada, what is old is new again. VoCs are more transmissible and more deadly, and experts are once again calling for lockdown . Across Saskatchewan, the citizenry is burdened by COVID fatigue, isolation, and the physical and mental exhaustion of the past 12 months. So are front-facing essential workers and health-care workers. The question of the moment from many is simple: ""Do we really need to lock down again? You ‘experts' have called for this before, and we were fine. What's different now?"" When I learned that in Regina between 70 and 80 per cent of recently screened cases were caused by VoCs , I felt the same sick pit in my stomach as I did a year ago. Widespread community transmission of VoCs in Regina will fuel widespread community transmission of VoCs across the province. It is only a matter of time. Hospitals and ICUs will fill again - they already have in Regina. This March, unlike last, we have a new weapon to fight COVID-19. We have vaccines against SaRs-CoV-2, and they work tremendously well. Even with VoCs like B.1.1.7 here in Saskatchewan, vaccines protect us against severe illness, hospitalization and death. We need to buy as much time as we can to vaccinate as much of the citizenry of the province as possible to prevent a significant surge from VoCs. To falter at this stage and be overwhelmed with new cases with vaccine so close at hand would be tragic irony. We have come so far, Saskatchewan, to fail now. I grew up in Ontario, did my post-graduate training in Alberta and began working full time in Regina in 2011. Much of what drew me to this province was the collective spirit of Saskatchewanians, the desire to do good by our provincial motto, Multis e gentibus vires - From Many Peoples Strength. We need to channel that collective spirit in this moment as we face our greatest threat. Please, follow the public health guidance, keep your personal and family bubbles extremely tight, isolate and test when symptomatic. And get vaccinated when it is your turn. That sick pit in my stomach is getting tiring. Like all of you, I am looking forward to our new normal when I will never have to experience that feeling again. We are stronger together, Saskatchewan. Make the best choices each day so we have time to get as many Saskatchewanians vaccinated as possible. Be safe, everyone. Dr. Alexander Wong is an infectious disease physician in Regina.

We need mandatory masks laws Postmedia Mandatory public masking has been saving lives and leading to an earlier (and safer) reopening of societies around the world. Despite this, Canadian officials have been reticent to support this cheap, effective measure. As of May 12, 13 U.S. states, including Illinois, New York and Massachusetts, and 84 countries, including Israel, Germany, Austria, Czechia and France, have laws mandating public masking. And zero Canadian jurisdictions. Opinion: Want to save lives and the economy? We need mandatory masks laws We are emerging from a severe lockdown, taking tentative steps into the unknown. Over a period of seven weeks, Canadians have endured the challenges of physical isolation. The pressure to reopen society is immense, but many share our concern that reopening will cause a second wave of cases. Advice for hand hygiene and physical distancing has been widely adopted and accepted. Why not masks? Citing asymptomatic and presymptomatic spread, on April 6 Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief medical officer of health, stated ""wearing a non-medical mask … is an additional measure that you can take to protect others around you in situations where physical distancing is difficult."" This is hardly a rousing endorsement. Similar weak recommendations have come from other public health officials, like Dr. Bonnie Henry of B.C., and Dr. Deena Hinshaw of Alberta. Public health officials presumably aren't convinced that evidence is strong enough to make a stronger recommendation for universal wear. The gold standard of evidence in medicine is the randomized controlled trial, where two populations are randomly assigned the intervention, and then a measurement of the intervention's effectiveness is made. Unfortunately, this doesn't exist for a population-scale intervention like masking. So instead we need to rely on the best available evidence, and the precautionary principle. Michael Ryan of the WHO says: ""If you need to be right before you move, you will never win. Perfection is the enemy of the good when it comes to emergency management."" As we learn more about asymptomatic spread, superspreader events, droplet transmission and the utility of masks as barriers, it is evident that masks play an important role. Countries with mandatory mask laws have seen their curves bend towards zero, contrary to countries with voluntary recommendations such as Canada, the U.K. and the U.S. There are exceptions, such as Iceland, Australia and New Zealand, which have successfully tamped down the curve without mandatory masks. Each has its own story, including massive testing, or extremely early lockdown. But these are few and far between. All of these layers, such as physical distancing, contact tracing, isolation, lockdowns, and masks, act to decrease the R0: the average number of people each viral-shedding person infects. Above 1? The infection grows in a population. Below 1? It shrinks. Scientists believe it could be up to 5.7 in a population without any mitigation measures. A recent scientific paper looked at how the combination of a mask's effectiveness and the proportion of a population wearing it worked to decrease the R0. If the mask is only moderately effective, as in cloth masks, the proportion wearing it needs to be high. For example, a cloth mask, which may only be 60 per cent effective, requires 60 per cent compliance to drop the Ro below one. In a recent poll, abysmally only 33 per cent of Canadians are wearing masks, Quebec being the worst at 24 per cent. Like many previous public health measures such as seatbelts, or bicycle helmets, compliance is poor until legislated. Similarly, if we want people to wear masks, we need them to be mandatory. Another advantage to masks, aside from saving lives, is reopening the economy. South Korea, Czechia, Austria, China are all countries with mandatory or high levels of mask compliance that have enabled their economies to open up, with minimal increases in COVID mortality. A recent economic analysis of mask use estimated a value of $3,000 to $6,000 to the economy for each mask worn. Possible harm? Literally billions of people are masking in 79 countries around the world without worsening their COVID-19 numbers - good evidence of minimal risk. Multiple provinces are starting to open up their economies. Quebec and Ontario are still in the throes of severe outbreaks. In both situations, mandatory masking will help save lives and prevent a recurrence, providing a massive return on investment. I protect you, you protect me. We all protect society.

Opinion: Pandemic has proven paid sick leave is a must,https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-pandemic-has-proven-paid-sick-leave-is-a-must,leaderpost.com,"If premiers act quickly to guarantee paid sick leave, this may reduce the likelihood of prolonged lockdowns, writes Dr. Charles S. Shaver.",['Dr. Charles S. Shaver'],2021-01-31 00:00:00,"The supply of vaccines to Canada has been interrupted for several reasons. We now rank 20th in the world in the immunization rate per capita. At the same time, we face the spread of new variants. These are more contagious, probably more lethal and perhaps somewhat resistant to current vaccines. To worsen the problem, by mid-January, 234 international flights to Canada had carried passengers infected with the virus. Justin Trudeau hence announced on Jan. 29 that flights between Canada and Mexico and the Caribbean would be cancelled until April 30 . International passengers would take a PCR test, and then wait in a hotel for three days for the result at a cost of $2,000. However, in addition, all premiers should set up more self-isolation centres, and guarantee paid sick leave to workers in essential areas such as healthcare. In Canada, as of late July, about 20 per cent of cases were in health workers - double the global average. By late January, about 15,000 in Ontario had been infected. At least 30 had died of the virus. Rates are higher in MDs than in other health professionals. Some 58 per cent of Canadian workers lack adequate sick leave. The new Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit pays $450 per week after taxes for up to two weeks, even to self-employed workers. Alberta has recently added an extra $625 after a 14-day period of quarantine. Unlike for paid sick days, persons must apply for a payment, it reimburses less than the minimum wage, does not cover those who wish a shorter leave and payment may take several weeks. These amounts are still inadequate to replace the lost income of physicians, most nurses and many other health professionals. More is needed if they are to be deterred from working; thus additional federal support is required. Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister stated several months ago, ""We want to encourage people not to work when they are ill and we want to make sure that they are not hurt financially."" His province has just agreed to provide major support to MDs for up to 20 days per year if they are forced to self-isolate or contract the coronavirus. Most physicians are self-employed and rely on private insurance, but those older than age 65 generally cannot qualify. For most, there is a waiting period of at least two weeks. Most provinces have recognized this fact. Saskatchewan, most other provinces, and the Yukon all cover their MDs for lost income from day one of self-isolation or illness. Most British Columbia MDs had been covered (up to age 70) by a government-funded disability plan. Those that were not, for months have been covered for quarantine or COVID-19 illness from day one. Only Alberta and Ontario have left their physicians financially unprotected."
Opinion: How to play the COVID-19 endgame,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-how-to-play-the-covid-19-endgame,nationalpost.com,"There is no magic to this process, just continued adherence to the core principles of public health and epidemic management","['Zain Chagla', 'Sumon Chakrabarti', 'Isaac Bogoch', 'Lynora Saxinger', 'Special To National Post']",2020-12-01 00:00:00,"By Drs. Zain Chagla, Sumon Chakrabarti, Isaac Bogoch and Lynora Saxinger In mid-March, for the first time in history, Canada went into lockdown as part of a desperate effort to control a novel pathogen. It is now late November and we are deep into the second wave. Long-term care facilities, though better protected since the first wave, are once again dealing with COVID-19 outbreaks and deaths. Admissions to hospitals, including intensive-care units, are piling on the back of a chronically overloaded health-care system. But despite this scenario being reminiscent of March, the current situation has some important differences, and much of that is due to our greater knowledge of the virus itself. In March, the threat was new and largely unknown. We all saw the fearsome images from Wuhan, China, Bergamo, Italy, and New York City. We pulled together, united and denied the virus much of its fuel - we closed everything but the essentials, in order to protect ourselves and our health-care system from being overwhelmed. And while the health-care system was not stretched beyond capacity, marginalized communities were disproportionately impacted by these restrictions. Now, polarization is creeping into some of our national and provincial conversations, as public health measures are increasingly perceived on a spectrum ranging from ""unfortunately necessary"" to ""useless and damaging."" As the pandemic drags on, the incentive to adhere to life-disrupting public health guidance may seem less and less relevant, especially to individuals who believe the risk they face is minimal. Further complicating matters is the fact that core components of our pandemic response require attention, including boosting our test-and-trace systems and offering better supports for those who are disproportionately impacted by both the virus and the policies designed to curb it. Emerging vaccine data provides a glimpse into a much brighter future, with roll-out expected to begin in the first quarter of 2021. But we first need to safely navigate the challenging winter months ahead. No radical paradigm shifts are necessary; we just need to focus on the fundamental tenets of our epidemic response and integrate the lessons that have been learned in Canada and abroad. This involves strengthening policies that will drive case numbers down, doing everything possible to maintain lower levels of community transmission, better protecting vulnerable populations and preventing our health-care system from being overwhelmed. There are four key principles that we need to focus on during the months ahead. First, we need measures to reduce nonessential indoor interactions, as well as protect schools and essential workplaces. This is a job not just for public health officials, but for individuals, as well. We need to limit our overall indoor interactions with non-household members during high transmission periods, which will help lower community transmission. For our essential interactions, we should prioritize indoor masking, distancing, ventilation and hand-washing. We also need to do a better job of protecting essential workplaces, hospitals and schools. Second, we need to support essential workers and marginalized communities. Many essential workers cannot work from home. They are involved in food services, caring professions, transport and infrastructure work - all jobs that directly support Canadian society. These individuals require safe workplaces, with universal indoor masking, physical distancing, ventilation and safe places to take breaks. Essential workers should have easy access to paid sick leave, which minimizes financial instability when symptomatic or exposed, and subsequently reduces workplace transmission. Access to facilities where people with large households can safely isolate should also be readily available. Supporting worker safely will reduce transmission and reduce pandemic-related disruptions to workplaces. Third, we must strengthen our testing, tracing, isolation and support systems. Every symptomatic person should be able to easily access testing, and receive timely results and guidance. Public health units require infrastructure and personnel to bolster their contact-tracing systems, which will help protect at-risk individuals, reduce community transmission and better inform our public health response. The appropriate use of rapid tests should be prioritized in high-risk areas, such as long-term care homes and remote communities. These rapid tests may not rule out all infection, but positive tests could help identify contagious individuals who should then isolate. Finally, governments must recognize the importance of community engagement and communication. Meaningfully engaging communities and providing information that is age, language and culturally appropriate, through conventional and social media platforms, will help communities understand and adapt to policy measures, drive positive behavioural change and help keep our communities safe. None of the aforementioned measures are new, and all of them have been implemented across Canada to varying degrees. Sticking with this blueprint, and improving how we implement it, will guide us safely into the vaccine era. The initial batch of vaccines is expected to reduce overall deaths and decrease health-care utilization, even if a relatively small initial supply is prioritized for those who face the greatest risk of severe infection. As vaccination campaigns expand, population vaccine-induced immunity will be the major milestone on our march back to normalcy. In the meantime, we need to double down on our public health efforts, and increase the consistency of our federal, provincial, municipal and individual responses, in order to lower rates of transmission and keep them low. , providing support for impacted groups, engaging communities and communicating effectively.

Opinion: We are infectious disease experts. It's time to lift the COVID-19 lockdowns,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-we-are-infectious-disease-experts-its-time-to-lift-the-covid-19-lockdowns,nationalpost.com,Canada needs a hospital capacity-based approach to guide local lifting and reintroduction of restrictive measures as necessary,"['Neil Rau', 'Susan Richardson', 'Martha Fulford', 'Dominik Mertz', 'National Post']",2020-05-21 00:00:00,"By Neil Rau, Susan Richardson, Martha Fulford and Dominik Mertz The past two months have shown that with major sacrifices, the community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus could be slowed down. In Canada, we can rightfully say that we were able to ""flatten the curve"" to avert a northern Italy or New York City scenario. Now we face the unintended consequences: delays in medical care for non-COVID-19 patients, educational impacts, the looming pandemic of mental-health issues, and massive economic repercussions. Widespread restrictions certainly cannot be sustained until an effective and safe vaccine is widely available, which may not occur for years, if ever. And the virus is unlikely to disappear from Canada or the world any time soon. Did the lockdown achieve the desired goals? Yes and no. Success in ""flattening"" the outbreak curve permitted the health-care system to handle the surge in cases safely and to avoid unnecessary deaths. But, we were not successful in protecting the elderly and frail population in nursing homes, where roughly 80 per cent of Canada's deaths occurred. It is important to point out that more than 95 per cent of COVID-19 deaths occurred in those over 60, compared with none under age 20. Protection of the former group deserves the most attention; this will be easier if limited resources are diverted from other, low-risk groups. In Canada, the individual rate of death from COVID-19 for people under 65 years of age is six per million people, or 0.0006 per cent. This is roughly equivalent to the risk of dying from a motor vehicle accident during the same time period. In other countries where data are available, 0.6-2.6 per cent of deaths in people below age 65 have occurred in people without known underlying health conditions. Although the risk of death is small in this group, ongoing research to discover the critical risk factors for death from COVID-19 in younger age groups must remain a top priority. This will permit us to better protect those at risk, while loosening restrictions for the majority. The virus is unlikely to disappear from Canada or the world any time soon It is also time to continue releasing lockdown measures. Remember, the original approach of ""flattening the curve"" was to relax restrictions if the system was not overwhelmed. That is still the appropriate goal. It is unlikely that zero infections can be achieved for COVID-19, which fundamentally spreads like influenza or the common cold, including from those without symptoms. The virus causes disease so mild in many people that it can circulate without detection, until it is introduced into a vulnerable population. While some advocate waiting for a vaccine, that would mean continuation of a lockdown for an unknown period of time. This approach ignores how complicated and difficult vaccine development can be. It is entirely possible that in two years we will still not have a vaccine, and very probable that a vaccine will not eliminate the virus entirely. Hence, we need to come to terms with the fact that we cannot eliminate this virus. At best, we can continue to slow its spread, and protect the frail and elderly. Governments now propose that we test and trace all contacts of identified cases of disease. As we embark on this stage, we will find cases that would previously have gone unnoticed. Ironically, the better our testing capacity and the more we look, the more we will find, making it appear that disease is worsening, when it isn't. This is particularly problematic as restrictions are being lifted. Should we automatically reinstate restrictions when the number of cases increases? No. Instead we should use local hospital capacity as the guiding principle, ensuring that all patients who need hospital or ICU care can get it. This is not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution: what happens in an urban centre is different from what happens in smaller cities or rural areas of Canada. Photo by Gavin Young/Postmedia News We need a tailored regional approach if the local hospital system gets strained. Germany, for example, chose a local threshold of 50 new cases per 100,000 population per week for when reinstitution of lockdown measures must be considered based on local capacity. The Ontario equivalent using the same threshold would be 7,300 new cases per week, or 1,043 per day. In contrast, Ontario has recommended a much lower provincewide threshold of 200 new community cases of infections per day as a threshold for action. This is based on an estimate of the ability of the system to accommodate the required contact tracing for every diagnosed case at the provincial level. The number of community cases should not be the metric of choice for relaxing restrictions as it is not a reflection of the more critical measure, hospital capacity. In addition, time spent on contact tracing is neither necessary nor feasible for all community cases, as it misses asymptomatic and covert transmission. Instead, testing and contact tracing should be focused mainly on hospitals and long-term care institutions, where the impacts of disease are the highest. Accepting ongoing sustainable levels of transmission might be a healthier option in the long term. While the lockdown has decreased transmission of the virus in the short run, it has also prevented the development of population immunity in low-risk people. We should embrace the benefits of the development of immunity in a growing segment of the population. Right now, the only means of achieving this is by natural infection. Recent data suggests that the human body reacts no differently to this virus than to other respiratory viruses: it mounts immunity, and once achieved, the virus gets cleared and there is protection from future infection. Given the novelty of the virus we do not have long-term data, but we know from 2003 SARS that immunity may last up to 13 years. Once a vaccine is available that would be the preferred option. However, there is no guarantee of whether and when a vaccine will be available, or how effective it will be, to say nothing of how broad the uptake of it will be in the population. Photo by David Kawai/Bloomberg Will this approach cost more deaths? Sweden, which allowed for more community transmission, is the measure of this strategy. More deaths per capita did occur than in Canada. On the positive side, Sweden's number of new cases has peaked and Sweden will be better protected against future waves and the need for future restrictions. In the absence of a vaccine, it is a question of paying now or paying later. While the realistic goal of Canada's lockdown was to delay deaths, it was never going to avoid them entirely. One year from now, Canada and Sweden may well have the same number of deaths per capita, but Canada may have had significantly more economic and social impacts. Canada needs a model that uses a hospital capacity-based approach to guide local lifting and reintroduction of more restrictive measures, as necessary. In the absence of hospital strain, consider continuing with a swift release of lockdown measures, to include opening of elementary schools, playgrounds, workplaces, stores and restaurants, while following basic physical distancing rules and voluntary limitations to social gatherings, while continuing to ban mass gatherings and protecting the elderly and those at highest risk.

Maybe that's what Canadians need to do after Dr. Theresa Tam has prescribed the nation strict social distancing measures that will continue through the summer and perhaps even go into the beginning of the fall. You know what that means: No sports. No patio season. No family camping trips. Kiss the summer of 2020 goodbye, Canada. Not just that, though. It also means the continued forced closure of the economy for months to come. On Thursday, Statistics Canada reported that 1,011,000 jobs were lost in Canada in March. Another 2 million people were technically still employed but saw their work hours drastically reduced. While the feds and provinces are doing all they can to prop the economy up, individuals and businesses are falling through the cracks and the longer this goes on the more businesses will close their doors and families will face serious hardships. The justification for a closure throughout the summer came during Dr. Tam's press conference on Thursday announcing the projections for infected cases and fatalities. If no measures are followed at all, the charts showed, 80% of Canadians could be infected with as many as 350,000 deaths. However, if we keep our current stringent measures in place the virus will have a much reduced death toll of 4,500 lives throughout its course. The Canadian Press reported that ""Tam said it appeared the spread of the virus was moderating somewhat and that Canada could bring the epidemic under control by the end of summer if social distancing and other measures in place were strictly adhered to. With spotty controls, we could still be battling the tail end of the pandemic a year from now, she said."" It's a punch to the gut, that's for sure. The idea that this new reality will persist for almost six more months will be too much for some to bear. When Ontario first announced schools were closing, it was for two weeks following March Break. That has since been extended, of course, but the province committed itself to taking things two weeks at a time. Why isn't the Public Health Agency of Canada doing the same and agreeing to take things a week or two at a time? In some respects, Dr. Tam and her provincial counterparts have wielded more power over Canadian life than any other public servant or politician in history, more so than prime ministers or the likes of cabinet minister C.D. Howe, who was called The Minister of Everything during the Second World War. Is anyone double-checking Dr. Tam's work? Is anyone in a position of power pushing back? Is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau seeking a second opinion, like most people would after being given such a harsh diagnosis? This is not a personal shot at the experience and resume of Dr. Tam, who has authored over 55 peer-reviewed journal publications and is the former assistant deputy minister for infectious disease prevention. It's just common sense questions that everyone should be asking when dealing with a situation of such colossal magnitude. That, and anyone who is reading about COVID-19 strategies around the world will know that there is no settled science here and experts are in stark disagreement. ""The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted just how many ways that scientists and other academic experts can disagree,"" writes Alyson Nicholds, a public policy professor from Staffordshire University, in an essay for The Conversation titled Coronavirus: Why experts disagree so strongly over how to tackle the disease . The strategies around the world are diverse. While some countries' top epidemiologists are urging complete lockdowns, a number of other top public health officials, such as those in Sweden, are resisting lockdowns on the basis that the societal and economic damages may outweigh those of the virus. We haven't heard much about those secondary, but perhaps equally bad, effects from Canadian officials. Are they factoring them in? Or are they singularly focused on their specialization, on beating back the number of infected cases whatever it takes? There's also the fact that many experts have been flip-flopping, both in Canada and elsewhere, on things ranging from whether or not asymptomatic cases could infect others to whether travel bans and face masks work. This is to be expected in a fast-changing situation, but it has still undeniably harmed the credibility of our top health officials in the eyes of the public and will make rigid enforcement throughout the summer that much more difficult. Maybe Dr. Tam is right that the only way to beat this down is to live in relative lockdown until the fall. Or maybe the experts who disagree are right. That's quite a coin toss to make. Let's hope that the leaders Canadians elected to make whole-of-society decisions for us at the very least aren't just blindly following the recommendations of health officials, that they're weighing all of the options and that they're taking the time to get a second opinion.

For those who make it a point to be at a cenotaph every Nov. 11, I will remind you that cenotaphs are in place 24/7. You are free to visit and pay your respects anytime. Without the crowds, the hallowed ground of your local cenotaph takes on a far more solemn atmosphere. I swear I can feel the energy of everyone who wore the uniform before me radiating through the stone and epitaphs of that sacred space. This leads me into a project that you and your family can engage in this Remembrance Day. The records of First World War soldiers are available online, free of charge. I urge you to look up a name or two. I often sit and read through the records of a random soldier or nursing sister. These documents humanize the names that we see on the cenotaphs and, in turn, we start to get a picture of who they were. (Spoiler alert: They are not much different from you or me.) Something I like to do in the lead-up to Nov. 11 is to level up my knowledge of military history. I especially like to try to find accounts from the troops on the front lines or to learn about some of the more obscure and lesser known battles or actions. Canada has a rich military history that touches pretty much every major conflict in some way, not to mention the many peacekeeping missions that Canada has been involved in. Go down a Wikipedia rabbit hole, watch a documentary, check out a history book from the library, or research your own family's history. There are countless resources available to assist you both online and offline. Yes, we are not going to be able to gather this Remembrance Day the way we normally would, but that is not an excuse to forgo reflecting and remembering. Nov. 11, 2000, saw me sitting in the back of a Grizzly armoured vehicle providing security for the Bosnian elections. We still took two minutes of silence on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month to reflect on our brethren who made the ultimate sacrifice. If 19-year-old kids could face death storming a beach in 1944, you can take two minutes out of your day to remember them, and find a way to pay your respects in spite of COVID-19. At the least, take to social media to show that you are wearing a poppy, learning about Canada's involvement in conflicts or visiting the graves of soldiers. Our soldiers did not let evil win, and you certainly should not let COVID-19 win by breaking faith with those who died. Lest we forget. Under the red-zone restrictions covering much of Quebec, Remembrance Day commemorations are being significantly pared down this year. In Montreal, the ceremony at Place du Canada is closed to spectators. The national ceremony in Ottawa can be viewed on television or via Facebook.

Yet, COVID-19, a particularly virulent virus, dominated our lives and livelihoods in 2020 and will continue to shape them throughout the coming year. Its toll on public health, economies, government finances, businesses, and families will last for decades. We had been warned. On May 15, 2017, the cover of Time magazine blared, ""Warning: We are not ready for the next pandemic."" A second ""black swan"" crisis in just two decades points to the need for better contingency planning and greater resiliency built into our core health, financial and economic systems. We should not forget these lessons as we look ahead. Canadian governments and Canadians face five must-tackle challenges in 2021. These will test our capacity for creative, collaborative, longer-term thinking, and whether we can raise our policy game to emerge stronger and more resilient in the post-COVID world. Opinion: There are five must-tackle challenges for Canada in 2021 The first test for all governments is to control the pandemic. Without flattening the COVID curve, the nascent recovery will be planked. As we begin the initial phase of vaccinating Canadians, we are experiencing a significant second wave of the pandemic, leading to renewed lockdowns in various parts of the country and increasing pressures on the healthcare system. The slower the execution of the vaccination program, the slower the economic recovery and the greater the economic and social costs. We should have been better prepared after Canada's experiences with SARS in 2003 and H1N1 in 2009. The second is a growth strategy for the recovery and beyond. The economy will not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2022, and that assumes a vaccine-assisted rebound combined with a shift in government spending from income and liquidity support to growth-enhancing measures. Beyond the immediate challenge of recovery, which is to get back to pre-COVID levels, we also face a troubling drop in longer-term real growth to 1.2 per cent according to Bank of Canada estimates. Rebuilding Canada's potential growth will require a clear plan to improve our competitiveness, encourage productive investments and create a Canadian global advantage. Governments cannot solve all problems, but they can help create the conditions to make the private sector more successful. We are at one of those pivotal moments. A third test is the glaring absence of a fiscal anchor from the government's policy playbook. A fiscal anchor is not something that waits for better times - it is something that is a prerequisite for sustained better times. Federal debt will have risen an astounding 75 per cent between last year and next year according to the Fall Economic Statement 2020. This debt burden, which future generations will bear, comes at both a cost and a risk. Debt servicing costs are manageable while interest rates are at abnormally low levels because of the pandemic recession, but they will gradually rise as growth returns and so will the costs of the mountain of new debt. The more immediate risk is that international financial markets begin to lose faith in our ability to manage our fiscal affairs. To avoid this, and its caustic effects on growth and confidence, the government should articulate a credible fiscal anchor. A related challenge is fiscal federalism: provincial fiscal situations are not good, some are dire, and all believe that increased federal transfers are in order, particularly since the federal government has loudly argued it has unused fiscal firepower. The health system clearly has to be better prepared for future pandemics, and this will take money, partnerships and surge capacity. And, with the Liberal government signalling new policy ambitions in areas of provincial or shared jurisdiction, the price tags to encourage provincial buy-in will be lofty. The fifth test is reconciling climate change and the Canadian energy sector, where the narrative has to change. Energy is our biggest export earner, and a major source of value-added growth, well-paying jobs and tax revenues. Climate change is a fundamental threat to the future. The challenge is how to sustain a robust Canadian energy sector and make progress on climate change - it is not an ""either or"" choice, it is about achieving both. And this is not just an Alberta problem, it is a pan-Canadian issue - both economically and politically. New thinking is desperately needed, such as the deployment of Generation IV small modular nuclear reactors to meet the steam and heat requirements of Alberta's heavy oil industry, which are currently met by carbon-intensive fuels. This would dramatically limit greenhouse gas emissions from oilsands operations, allowing time for the province to diversify its economy during the transition to renewable energy. As Samantha Gross of the Brookings Institution has argued, ""Those pushing to end fossil fuel production now are missing the point that fossil fuels will still be needed for some time in certain sectors. Eliminating unpopular energy sources or technologies, like nuclear or carbon capture, from the conversation is short-sighted. Renewable electricity generation alone won't get us there - this is an all-technologies-on-deck problem."" There are decades where nothing happens and there are weeks where decades happen. This saying seems particularly apt to describe what has transpired during the pandemic. And we will continue to be tested, but the focus will shift from the immediate crisis to the recovery and beyond. The longer-term challenges before us in 2021 will also demand a much more innovative and co-operative approach to policy-making - both at home and with our allies. Having been caught flat-footed, the questions we need to ask ourselves today are do we have the necessary planning skills within government, the right incentives for private-sector expansion, and the collective will and wisdom to ""build back better""?

Your editorial comment to the R. Pruden letter about (against) fining lockdown or mask protesters, ""Sorry, but you don't get to decide which laws you will respect"", could be directed to poor souls at Tiananmen Square or many other victims of tragedies (massacres) in communist regimes. They disobeyed wrong laws, according to your comment. When peaceful protesters are being penalized (financially or otherwise), it's a beginning sign of tyranny, not a free, democratic society.

History provides numerous examples of entire industries collapsing, with a devastating effect on working classes. The coal industry in Wales, the cod fishing industry in Atlantic Canada are two easy examples. There are others. Now it's Alberta's turn. Forces are at work to destroy the energy industry, for generations the driver of prosperity for Alberta and Canada. But hey, (deleted) happens. So, Alberta oil workers should declare themselves commercial fisherpersons. That way, they can work for three months and ride the public purse for the other nine months.

CARBON TAX IS GOOD Re: Kris Sims' Dec. 15 guest opinion. Why does she only talk about the cost of the carbon tax but not mention anything about its purpose or the tax credit rebate we all get to offset it ($666 for a couple and more if you have kids in 2019). I have a 2,500 sq. ft. house and paid $275 in carbon tax over the past 12 months. I have downsized to one vehicle and reduced my miles driven, which is the purpose of the tax, reduce emissions. Not only is it good for the environment but it also improves our way of life through less pollution, not to mention the savings to our health-care system that undoubtedly will occur when our air quality improves. The carbon tax is the only way to go as it penalizes those who pollute and benefits those who want to reduce emissions. Rather than just complain why not come up with a better solution.

Opinion: Alberta restaurants need long-term help recovering from COVID-19,https://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-alberta-restaurants-need-long-term-help-recovering-from-covid-19,edmontonjournal.com,"Restaurants and other food-service businesses are the third-largest source of private-sector jobs in Alberta. Collectively, the industry employs 150,000 people.",['Mark Von Schellwitz'],2020-06-07 00:00:00,"Photo by Greg Southam / Postmedia At least this was the case before COVID-19 led to as many as 95,000 food-service workers across the province losing their jobs or having their hours cut down to zero by April. Not only was the restaurant industry among the first and hardest hit by the pandemic, the sector will be among the slowest to return to profitability: Six of 10 Canadian food-service businesses are still operating at a loss, even as jurisdictions across the country are moving forward with reopening plans. With the average restaurant typically needing about a third of its operating budget just to cover labour costs, restaurateurs understandably breathed a sigh of relief on May 15, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that the federal government would be extending the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) program to Aug. 29. A month since the announcement, however, it's become clear that it's going to take more than a simple extension of this program to help restaurants bring more Albertans back to work. When initially introduced, the CEWS program was to run for 12 weeks, retroactive to March 15, limiting employers to only being able to benefit from the subsidy until June 6. The extension announcement gave hope to many restaurant operators who were not yet ready to reopen that this assistance might still be available once they're able to use it. The announcement was also welcomed by establishments that have remained open since emergency restrictions were first imposed, as most restaurants that have continued to operate take-out and delivery services have done so at a loss. But after months of significantly reduced revenue, or none at all, and now facing months of operating at reduced capacity, this is only the beginning of what will be a long and difficult road to recovery for Alberta's restaurants. Given this reality, they need continued government support for the long term, not just until an arbitrary end date. The wage subsidy should continue to be available to businesses as needed, to keep them from falling off cliffs when the assistance they're receiving with payroll suddenly drops from 75 per cent to zero. Instead, a smooth ramp of support that reduces as a restaurant gets closer to manageable levels of revenue variance would be the best way to extend the program. The requirement to demonstrate a 30-per-cent decline in revenue should also be scaled to remove any concern that increasing sales could result in losing access to the subsidy. This would help restaurants hang onto their staff while they're still working on generating enough revenue to no longer need government support. The wage subsidy has already helped Alberta's restaurant industry recover more than 7,000 jobs initially lost during the pandemic. But at least 70,000 people previously employed in the food-service sector were still out of work across the province in May. Reforming the wage subsidy will give restaurants greater capacity to bring more of these Albertans back to work.

"Raiyan Chowdhury: Canadians need to demand a thorough, independent inquiry into this country's COVID response",https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-canadians-need-to-demand-a-thorough-independent-inquiry-into-this-countrys-covid-response,nationalpost.com,"Only by holding our leaders accountable will we be better prepared to prevent a future crisis or, God forbid, a fourth wave, says critical care specialist","['Raiyan Chowdhury', 'Special To National Post']",2021-04-21 00:00:00,"Photo by Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press As a front-line ICU physician in Alberta who studies health-care quality, one thing that has surprised me the most during this pandemic is the apparent free pass the Canadian academic community has afforded our federal leadership and its response during this crisis. The medical community seems to have focused its critique solely on public lockdown measures at the provincial level. Yet, there has been little academic discussion around our significant failures in early vaccine procurement, scientific understanding of how this virus spreads, rapid testing, and effective border control. Our collective public focus to date has been almost entirely on debating the acceptable degree of public lockdowns needed for the greater good. Pandemic shaming this year has rivalled hockey as a national sport. During the first wave, this likely served us well. Now, as the U.S. and U.K. outperform us in delivering vaccines to their peoples, our per capita infection rate has climbed above both. The CDC this month asked Americans to avoid all travel to Canada. For a country that often prides itself on being morally and socially superior to our southern cousins on matters of health and universal care, this inglorious distinction not only demonstrates our failures on COVID, but it shakes the very core of how we see ourselves as Canadians. On any given day, there is another expert or physician in the media criticizing the Doug Ford or Jason Kenney governments for not going far enough or acting fast enough on lockdowns. These critics may have valid points. However, as Toronto's year-long experience has shown, lockdowns alone are not enough to overcome this crisis. A singular focus on social-distancing measures both in the Canadian medical community and media has distracted from meaningful critique and debate about all other aspects of our COVID response. Improved responses in such areas of federal control as vaccine procurement and border control likely would have averted a third wave. Unfortunately, in these aspects, the academic community has been silent. Improved responses ... likely would have averted a third wave The National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommended delaying second doses of two-shot COVID-19 vaccines by up to four months. While this may be the most prudent action to take given our severe vaccine shortage, what has alarmed me is the deafening silence the academic community has had on this most significant public health policy decision, perhaps the most significant in decades. The original studies on vaccine efficacy had limited the intervals to under one month. Keep in mind that this is the same academic community that resisted early use of masks and border closures based on lack of evidence. Similarly, despite having had one year to enact an effective method of stopping COVID variants at our border, we have failed miserably at keeping out cases imported from such places as Brazil. Special screening for such travellers was dropped by Ottawa without as much as a peep from experts in our academic community. Theresa Tam, our top doctor, this month continued to claim that she was correct when she said COVID-19 posed only a low risk to Canada at the beginning of the pandemic. At the same time, Justin Trudeau has no regrets about our vaccine rollout. Of course, since Theresa Tam made that statement, over 23,000 Canadians have died. As for kudos for our national vaccine plan, Canada currently sits at number 45 worldwide when considering the total percentage of the population fully vaccinated. The field of health quality evolved in medicine because of statements such as these. Rather than accepting the status quo as the best we can do, the field of health quality determines the root causes for failures in our health-care system, and seeks to improve outcomes through culture and system changes. This is exactly what Canada's public health response needs now. More On This Topic Rupa Subramanya: Canada must immediately suspend flights to and from India Matt Gurney: Doug Ford's bungling of the third wave is distracting from Justin Trudeau's many failures We need to shift our focus towards determining the root causes of our failures on a local, provincial and federal level. The most commonly quoted reason for Canada's vaccine failure has been the lack of domestic vaccine production infrastructure as a result of years of neglect. This may be part of the story, but we really don't know. Without formal assessments of our response, using a health quality paradigm, we continue to place the lives of Canadians at risk. As for our economy, the world's longest undefended border will continue to be closed, but this time it's Americans who will want to keep us out. Blaming leaders such as Trudeau or Tam for uninspired leadership is likely an over-simplistic approach. However, we do have to hold them accountable. Otherwise, politicians claiming that this is the best we could do, will prevent us from finding the root causes of our failures and ultimately improving upon them. A first step is replacing the blame-and-shame game and focusing on systems thinking. We must have a paradigm that acknowledges the human condition - namely, that humans err. A single ""sharp-end"" error (the person in the control booth in the nuclear plant, the surgeon making the incision, a church ignoring lockdown rules, a PM high on platitudes but low on action) is rarely enough to cause harm on this level. Instead, Canada's failure has involved errors across all levels of government that penetrated multiple incomplete layers of protection. A focus on pandemic shaming or being a good Canadian by taking it all in stride is unlikely to produce any meaningful changes to a response that's clearly broken. There is nothing unCanadian or partisan about demanding a high-profile independent inquiry into our response now. Only by holding our leaders accountable and demanding improvements and change will we be better prepared to prevent a future crisis or, God forbid, a fourth wave this fall. We owe at least that much to the Canadians who will unnecessarily die in this third wave.

The reasoning for this shutdown was simple. With very little knowledge on how the virus spread, and seeing catastrophic outbreaks in China and Italy, the government asked everyone to stay at home until public health experts had a chance to gain an understanding of the virus. Everyone was to chip in for this effort and Albertans responded well, as they always have when going through an emergency. There is a lot we can be proud of as Albertans and Canadians. And from our health-care heroes to our first responders, there are a lot of Albertans and Canadians to be proud of. While there have been many groups that have stepped up in the midst of this crisis, one that has made a major contribution and is often forgotten are the Canadians who work in our aviation sector. When the entire world went into lockdown, Canada's major airlines worked with the federal government and our airports to bring home thousands of Canadians stranded abroad. They helped to ship millions of dollars worth of necessary medical supplies and personal protective equipment. As most governments re-opened most businesses over the course of summer 2020, we learned more about the virus, including where it transmitted most quickly. We learned quite early on that airline travel, previously seen as a major vector of transmission, was actually quite safe as innovations in air filtration reduced the spread within planes. Minister Marc Garneau and Chief Medical Officer of Health Theresa Tam stated that they found no evidence of any transmission happening on board aircraft. International health agencies such as America's Centre for Disease Control and the World Health Organization verified that these were low-risk activities. Yet when the world plunged into a second wave, many of the lessons we learned over the first six months of the pandemic were forgotten. Some jurisdictions brought in nonsensical business policies allowing big-box stores to remain open while shutting down the smaller businesses that sold many of the same things. Others tried to parse what kind of goods were considered essential and should be allowed to be sold. Other groups chose to assign blame. Much of this blame was placed at the feet of Canadian airlines and travellers, despite a lack of evidence that airlines were contributing significantly to spread. An industry that employed 154,000 across Canada. At this point, airlines have spent over a year operating at a loss while taking extraordinary steps to protect customers with a federal government that has offered no support. They have taken real actions to harm the industry, ranging from draconian ""quarantine hotels"" to shutting down of provincial programs aimed to keep travel safe without being impossible. Neither of these decisions were evidence-based. What we need now is an evidence-based policy from governments that allows for some form of domestic and international travel to be done responsibly. This has been done largely around the world and it is time for Canada to catch up. Canada currently has restrictions for flying within our country. Similar restrictions exist nowhere else in the world. Canada also hasn't moved towards testing and limited quarantines for international travel while policies similar to that are being adopted throughout the world. Major companies and employers are at risk. A year ago, WestJet employed 14,000 people. Today, it's about 5,600. Tourism generally makes up 10 per cent of Canadian jobs, and the industry took almost twice the hit faced by other industries. As Albertans we may take for granted the privilege that comes with having a global airline based out of our province. We are now a year into the pandemic. The vaccination effort is well underway. Global COVID cases are falling quickly, and we understand a lot more about COVID-19. Vaccines are getting to Canada, in large part thanks to our aviation sector. We know that airline travel can be safe, even outside our borders. It is being done internationally, and the international pilot program run through Calgary International Airport proved that it can be done here. The aviation sector doesn't need a bailout. What they need is for governments to create policy that allows for safe air travel domestically and abroad with rigorous testing and precautions to keep it safe. It is now time for governments to give the aviation sector that certainty. John Liston is president of Alberta Enterprise Group.

Party gambling that no action on pandemic will equal political glory Government algebra is clear: hypocrisy + cowardice = political success. Rely on others and decant the dissent to them, writes Steven Lewis. Photo by BRANDON HARDER / Regina Leader-Post Saskatchewan has the lowest vaccination rate in Canada. This is by design; public policy guarantees low uptake. The government's rationale is crystal clear: ""I think you're infringing on people's personal rights if you're mandating things,"" Health Minister Paul Merriman said on Aug. 25. Merriman is correct: When public policy requires you to do something that you would not otherwise do, in a formal sense, your rights are infringed. The government has framed the vaccine debate as Big Brother vs. the sanctity of individual autonomy, which takes mandates off the table on principle. The results are avoidable sickness and death, exhausted health-care workers put perpetually at risk and ongoing economic chaos and uncertainty. Opinion: Sask. Party gambling that no action on pandemic will equal political glory So the government has taken a principled stand against mandates. Uh, no. Like all governments, the Saskatchewan Party mandates many things, like passing a driver's test and a surtax on electric vehicles. If violating individual rights were anathema, my right to drive as fast as I want would trump the government's imposition of a speed limit. My right to put up a 50-floor condominium wherever I want would trump zoning bylaws. There would be no functioning society without literally thousands of mandates that make all of us do what some of us don't want to do. No, the government isn't against mandates; it is against mandates that would offend a substantial portion of its political base. One might disagree with a government that declares individual autonomy as so sacred a principle that it is worth sacrificing the health and life of many people to uphold it. But it is at least a coherent position that takes courage to articulate and apply. What's critical is transparency: Tell the public why you're refusing to impose a mandate, and importantly, also publish estimates of how many people will get sick and die if, say, 250,000 people never get vaccinated vs. 50,000. Is that what Premier Scott Moe and Health Minister Merriman believe? Hell no. They encourage everyone to get vaccinated, because it's just common sense in the face of the pandemic. Moreover, they have from Day 1 gone on all-in on vaccines as the ultimate and self-sufficient weapon against COVID in the hope that measures requiring some individual sacrifice, like masking in indoor spaces and restrictions on mass gatherings, would be unnecessary. They clearly think it's wrong-headed to forego the vaccine. But they won't make anyone get it, because of their unshakable devotion to autonomy. Oh, but it's fine for others to impose mandates. The Saskatchewan Roughriders will require proof of vaccination to attend Mosaic Stadium, or a recent negative test result. Educational institutions will require vaccination for students to attend in person. Businesses can insist on proof of vaccination to enter their spaces. When asked, Moe and Merriman are fine with all of it. I suspect they're delighted. Oh but the government is cagey! Let retailers and restaurateurs take the heat from irate refuseniks rather than take it themselves. Let the opposition hang itself by calling for measures the government knows will prevent illness and death, but refuses to implement to keep the faithful happy. It can free ride on the goodwill and rationality of the majority while cementing its stranglehold on its base and starving the nascent Buffalo Party of political oxygen. The government's algebra is clear: hypocrisy + cowardice = political success. Off-load the decisions that take guts and discipline, rely on the fruits of others' labours, and decant the dissent to their sidewalks. It's a cynical strategy from a government with a seemingly ironclad grip on over 60 per cent of the electorate. It's what the province has signed up for. Saskatchewan is, for the foreseeable future, a one-party state. The province has botched the pandemic from the beginning, always reacting too late and doing too little, and it has abandoned all reasonable hope of attaining a vaccination rate anywhere close to achieving herd immunity. Yet Moe and his party remain immensely popular, while his Ontario and Alberta soulmates got hammered for similar missteps. One-party states, like all monopolies, don't perform in the long run because they don't have to. If Saskatchewan Party supporters don't demand more of their standard bearers, we will see more of the same on every issue.

Opinion: Ban on abortion protesters outside clinics protects patients,https://leaderpost.com/opinion/opinion-ban-on-abortion-protesters-outside-clinics-would-protect-patients-and-staff,leaderpost.com,"The zones protect the right to access services and safeguard health by reducing complications from emotional distress, writes Joyce Arthur.",['Joyce Arthur'],2021-12-09 00:00:00,"Opinion: Ban on abortion protesters outside clinics would protect patients and staff Opinion: Ban on abortion protesters outside clinics would protect patients and staff Photo by GAELEN MORSE / REUTERS When patients go to a health-care facility for treatment, they deserve to feel safe and have their privacy protected from the intimidating presence of anti-abortion protesters - and so do the people that work there. A private member's bill, introduced by MLA Jennifer Bowes in March and to be brought back this week, will help ensure that Saskatchewan residents who provide or receive abortion care will have their safety and dignity protected. As Bowes has said: ""It is far too common to hear stories of patients being aggressively harassed while simply trying to make the best medical decisions for their reproductive health. No patient or health-care service provider in this country should ever face harassment and intimidation for accessing or providing an essential service."" Opinion: Ban on abortion protesters outside clinics would protect patients and staff The Saskatchewan law would ban anti-abortion protesters within 50 metres of a facility, and in some cases 150 metres. British Columbia has enforced a very similar law since 1995 and it has been held to be constitutional. Therefore, we can be confident that Bill 608 would also meet Charter scrutiny. In fact, based on the legal soundness of the B.C. law, similar laws have been passed in five provinces: Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and Nova Scotia. Saskatchewan would simply be following in their footsteps. While safe access zone laws do infringe on free speech, it's not a blanket restriction. Protesters are free to protest anywhere except within a narrow zone around facilities that provide abortion. A key part of our Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Section 1, allows fundamental rights like freedom of expression to be limited in a reasonable manner to protect other rights. Protesters also should not be allowed to force their message onto a captive audience - in this case people accessing a medically necessary service that's available at only handful of locations in Saskatchewan. The B.C. Court of Appeal ruled in 2008 (R. v. Spratt, 2008 BCCA 340) that the Access to Abortion Services Act is constitutional because women's right to access a necessary medical treatment in an atmosphere of privacy, safety and dignity takes precedence over freedom of expression in that specific context. When the protesters appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, it declined to take the case, meaning the law stands as constitutional. The B.C. law has successfully deterred protesters and protected people at clinics for 26 years. After the law passed in 1995, protesters stopped coming to one clinic, while at another clinic, protesters had to stand across the street and could no longer approach or identify patients entering the clinic. Clinics in B.C. and across the country have reported that their safe access zone laws work well. Although a legal challenge is currently happening in Ontario, launched by an Ottawa protester, we are confident the government will prevail based on evidence and past precedent. Safe access zones are important because they ensure the safety and privacy of providers, staff and patients as they come and go from the facility. The zones protect the right to access health-care services and safeguard patients' health by reducing the risk of complications from emotional distress (caused by the protesters) just before undergoing a medical procedure. Further, the zones foster community peace by reducing neighbourhood nuisance and noise and other hazards, and limiting the risk of violence and vandalism. Some opposed to safe access zones claim that existing laws against assault and harassment should be used instead. This won't work because it requires people to press charges and testify in court. Women going to a clinic for a procedure as private and stigmatized as abortion virtually never pursue criminal charges. Second, it's not just criminal activities that pose a problem - the mere presence of ""peaceful"" protesters causes anxiety and fear for patients and gives rise to confidentiality concerns. Given the intrusive nature of anti-choice protests outside facilities that provide abortion, people deserve the ongoing protection and privacy that only a safe-access zone law can provide. We urge all Saskatchewan MLAs to vote in favour of this important bill to protect the safety, dignity and privacy of patients who need an abortion.

Their decisions will have a direct and sustained impact on our physical, mental, social and economic well-being . Policy-makers must be guided above all by evidence, because as they say, ""Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not to their own facts."" Our review of World Health Organization guidance suggests it's time for governments to revisit the drastic measures of closing all parks and recreation amenities. In the early days of the COVID-19 crisis, valid evidence was at a premium. As the potential scale of the pandemic emerged, most jurisdictions chose speed over precision. In military terms, because of a lack of intelligence on how and where to target, governments decided on a broad carpet-bombing containment strategy, rather than targeted surgical strikes. The result was governments in Canada and across the world put broad restrictions on citizens' movements to slow the spread of COVID-19 and minimize stress on health-care systems. This was prudent and the past four weeks of data suggest it is working. However, after almost a month, like other countries, it's time to revisit those decisions based on nuanced and contextual evidence. It's time to use the benefit of this evidence to be far more precise. In fact, the WHO is so concerned about the spread of COVID-19 misinformation that it introduced a Myth busters website to battle the real threat of what it is deeming an ""infodemic."" This infodemic is not spreading based on facts, it's spreading based on fear. As Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister (taoiseach) and a medical doctor, declared: ""We need to halt the spread of the virus, but we also need to halt the spread of fear, fear is a virus in itself."" One specific policy area we believe it is essential to refine is the blanket closure of parks, recreational and public spaces, and proposals to expand and extend these closures. While the WHO remains vigilant and focused on restricting the spread of COVID-19, it has also raised concerns about the longer-term impact of mass quarantines on mental and physical wellness. The WHO and many other public health experts do not believe that constraining the spread of COVID-19 and maintaining physical and mental well-being are mutually exclusive. In fact, the WHO introduced guidelines to promote physical activity, including guidelines on walking, running, cycling and use of parks and other public spaces. Similarly, the physical distancing guidance provided by public health experts at a provincial and national level are consistent: maintaining physical activity, while also physical distancing, is a critical component of a holistic COVID-19 prevention strategy. Therefore, we are perplexed that many governments in our country, contradicting the nuanced guidance of public health professionals around physical distancing and safe physical activity, continue to formally or informally restrict safe physical activities. As we shift into spring and summer, these contradictory positions must be aligned to introduce holistic COVID-19 prevention policies that not only enable but promote physical activities that align with the most current physical distancing guidelines. As we've seen on the crowded pathways in the past few days, without a sustainable holistic plan, the mass closing of parks and recreation amenities is concentrating Calgarians into a smaller number of spaces and negatively impacting both physical distancing and physical activity. As a start, we propose four actionable recommendations for leaders at all levels to adopt: Prioritize physical and mental well-being: As part of a holistic COVID-19 community prevention strategy, all communities should establish a task force on physical and mental well-being. This task force should adopt an evidence-based decision framework focused on the question: How can we safely use parks and recreation amenities to promote physical activity that aligns with current physical distancing guidelines? This challenges the pervasive position adopted during the first month, which is best described as ""Keep it simple and close everything regardless of the level of risk."" This should include contextualizing evidence from other jurisdictions such as Austria and the Czech Republic and which are testing innovative adaptations of sport and recreation activities that maintain physical distancing while promoting health and wellness. Prioritize funding to safely reopen amenities: As part of this holistic strategy, governments must prioritize funding to support the safe reopening of local, provincial and national parks and recreation amenities in a manner that aligns with both physical distancing and physical activity guidelines. For example, this could include the creative use of the Canada Summer Jobs grants to hire students as physical distancing ambassadors in parks, trails, pathways, golf courses, tennis courts, basketball courts, waterways and playgrounds. Sensible adaptations might include closing clubhouses and showers, mandating that tennis courts only be open for singles matches and basketball courts only for shooting hoops, not games. Introduce a zero-tolerance policy: Governments should introduce a zero-tolerance policy for those who violate the safe use of our parks and recreation amenities and threaten the health and wellness of the broad community. Penalties should range from significant fines to banning future access to all public recreation amenities. Promote the importance of safe physical activity: Maintaining both physical activity and physical distancing is critical to the sustained social, physical, and mental well-being of citizens and communities. Governments must challenge the misinformation, fear and public shaming entrenched on social media that suggests that all community-based physical activity is a threat to public safety. As part of this, governments must guide citizens to timely, evidence-based health and wellness information, including the use of parks and recreation amenities. Evidence must trump fear. An essential step in our country's COVID-19 recovery strategy is for leaders to adopt evidence-based policies that promote the physical and mental well-being of all Canadians, Albertans and Calgarians. It's time to get some exercise. Be safe. David J.

Opinion: More testing is vital to contain pandemic spread,https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-more-testing-is-vital-to-contain-pandemic-spread/,leaderpost.com,"Testing must be aggressive, including early intervention with communities, and with vulnerable patients, to avert serious symptoms that will stress emergency care, writes Jim Harding.",['Jim Harding'],2020-04-14 00:00:00,"Finally, we have provincial scenarios. The Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) assumes 15 per cent to 40 per cent of people will get infected. But why is their lowest projection of 3,075 people dying, within our small population, so close to China's total? And why was their lowest estimate higher than provinces with larger populations? Why did the Public Health Agency national scenario have a low estimate of 11,000 deaths for all Canada? There is lots of room for public confusion. By World Health Day (April 7), five per cent of those diagnosed globally had died. It was over 10 per cent for Italy and Spain but only over one per cent for Germany. U.S. was at three per cent, and Canada two per cent, the figure SHA uses. These seemingly small differences make a huge difference in lives lost or saved. We should know why death rates are so variable; Ontario so far at nearly four per cent, B.C. above three per cent, while Quebec is above one per cent. SHA modelling is vague, with no prediction for peaking or timeframe for social distancing. SHA claims it can't be specific because the disease ""progression here is behind"" other places. Actually, this lag is what enables more effective strategies. This also requires federally co-ordinated leadership. What is the specific strategy to stop transmission so that feared surges don't occur? What's the plan for at-risk Indigenous communities ? S HA's ""key strategies"" are increasing testing to identify cases early and allow contact tracing . We know from abroad that this is vital, but it must be aggressive, including early intervention with communities, and with vulnerable patients, to avert serious symptoms that will stress emergency care. Our testing rate of 1,000 per 100,000 by April 3, was second highest, after Alberta. B.C. and Quebec were similar, but Ontario was lower (445). We need standardized practices everywhere."

Opinion: Will we look back on vaccine mandates as we do on mandatory seatbelts? Photo by Timothy A. Clary/AFP via Getty Images files I was a junior high school student at Swift Current's O.M. Irwin School in the late 1970s when the province of Saskatchewan introduced its seatbelt law . Saskatchewan was the third province to mandate seatbelts, and the 1977 law required drivers, front-seat passengers and children under 16 to buckle up. The seatbelt law aroused a good deal of controversy across the province, which I remember well, in part because the Irwin School debate club decided to take up the topic. The question posed was something like, ""Should the Saskatchewan government require the use of seatbelts?"" The Yes side went first and presented a LOT of data - studies, statistics, charts, and so forth - proving beyond a doubt, it seemed to me, that seatbelts reduced injuries and saved lives. Opinion: Will we look back on vaccine mandates as we do on mandatory seatbelts? By the time the Yes side finished its opening argument, I felt sorry for the No side that was about to present their case. ""Poor students,"" I thought. ""They don't stand a chance. It's not even a fair debate question."" When the No side began, its speakers immediately agreed with everything the Yes side had presented! Seatbelts surely reduced injuries and saved lives, they concurred. But that was not the debate question. The question, they explained, was whether the Saskatchewan government should mandate their use. Simply put, should seatbelts be required by law? My memory of that moment is that the air left the room. Suddenly, everything the Yes side had just presented about how well seatbelts worked seemed, well, beside the point. For me, at least, it was a remarkable moment, and one I still remember vividly - no doubt with the embellishment of nostalgia. The balance of the No case in that junior-high seatbelt debate focused, as you might well imagine, on the limits of governmental authority and the importance of individual rights and freedoms. Outside the classroom, and despite the irritation of a good many Saskatchewan drivers, the seatbelt law stood. In those days, tickets were $20. Over time, province after province enacted similar mandates. Alberta was the last to do so, a full decade behind Saskatchewan. Gradually, seatbelt laws evolved . In time, everyone had to wear a seatbelt, and requirements were added for special car seats for infants and booster seats for young children. And the fines went up too. Unsurprisingly, injuries and deaths from car accidents decreased over time, as seatbelt use increased. But compliance was spotty in the early 1980s. As a teenager, I remember unbuckling so I could lie down in the back seat on road trips with my parents. Even as an adult, I would often neglect to buckle up for short trips around town, when I was on my own in the car. These days, that's almost impossible. My car nags me until I engage my seatbelt. My semi-conscious and token resistance - the residue of growing up in the 1970s - is to put my car in drive and buckle up as the car starts to roll forward. But some Canadians resisted seatbelt laws more forcefully. In 1987, Kim Maier, ""a bit of a maverick,"" challenged Alberta's brand-new seatbelt law by ""circling the Calgary police station with his seat belt hanging out the door."" Then, ""he put a sign on his truck announcing his misdeed to the world."" Finally, ""he took to shouting at passing police cruisers: ‘Hey, I'm not wearing a seat belt. Give me a ticket.'"" On July 5, 1987, after taunting Calgary police for eight hours , Maier got the ticket he craved. In court, Maier quickly confessed that he was guilty of the law as written, but that was not the point. What he wanted was to challenge the law itself, arguing that the seatbelt mandate was an infringement of ""his right to ‘life, liberty, and security of the person' as guaranteed by Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms."" Like others - you'll remember this if you're old enough - he argued that seatbelts were dangerous, because they could trap drivers in their vehicles, make them slide under the dash in the event of an accident, or pose a danger to pedestrians and cyclists because drivers wearing seatbelts would feel overconfident and drive recklessly at faster speeds. Maier called various witnesses who testified along these lines. One even tried to prove that seatbelts didn't actually reduce injuries or save lives. Given our long-running experience of seatbelt use, you will not be surprised to learn that the court ruled that ""the principle of fundamental justice"" had not been violated. Moreover, the judge determined that the benefits of seatbelts justified the mandating of their use as ""a reasonable limit (to freedom) demonstrably justified in a free and democratic country."" Maier appealed and the seatbelt law was temporarily called into question until the Alberta Court of Appeal once more confirmed the original judgment. Maier remained steadfast in his anti-seatbelt convictions. His rationale? ""I like risk and I think seatbelts reduce my enjoyment of life. I'm doing this so that my kids can enjoy life."" He tried to appeal his case to the Supreme Court of Canada, but the court refused to consider the case . Today, we're engaged in a similar debate about COVID-19 vaccines, which are the product of an unprecedented emergency global research collaboration. Their development and approval have been marked by abundant funding, extensive testing, and a top-priority-no-red-tape path through a normally bureaucratic regulatory process. While some still argue that vaccines are ineffective, unsafe or worse, other Canadians express concern over the role of the government in requiring vaccines through a vaccine mandate (in Alberta, the "" Restrictions Exemption Program "") and a vaccine passport (in Alberta, the "" card-sized vaccination record ""). I have no doubt there will be court challenges to vaccine mandates across Canada, based on constitutional grounds. I expect they will fail, in much the same way as Kim Maier's seatbelt case failed in the 1980s and 1990s. What is both more important and more hopeful, I would argue, is the way in which the government legislation of seatbelt use changed our views - our culture - over time. Few today would argue that seatbelt laws are controversial. More than that, our attitudes have evolved. Today, most of us would gasp if we saw a family driving down the freeway with a parent sitting in the front seat holding an infant on their lap - neither with any restraint holding them in - even though many of us grew up that way. And while historians like me generally avoid predictions about the future - we know that life rarely unfolds quite the way we expect it to - we do seek to learn lessons from the past that will help us in our present lives. Considering the history of seatbelt legislation, then, I think it's reasonably likely that, a decade or two from now, we will look back in wonderment over both the vaccine hesitancy of some Canadians and the angry protests of a smaller anti-vaccination faction. And tragically, as with seatbelts, some among us will carry the lifelong pain of family members lost to needless death.

Opinion: COVID is a wakeup call that rights and freedoms can be tested in a crisis,https://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-covid-is-a-wakeup-call-that-rights-and-freedoms-can-be-tested-in-a-crisis,edmontonjournal.com,"With the worsening ongoing pandemic, public health protocols have called for exceptional measures in Alberta and elsewhere in Canada, including restricting…",['Sandeep Agrawal'],2020-11-08 00:00:00,"Photo by Greg Southam / Postmedia With the worsening ongoing pandemic, public health protocols have called for exceptional measures in Alberta and elsewhere in Canada, including restricting movement and prohibiting assembling. This includes constraints on gatherings in places of worship and, indeed, even in our own homes. Politicians and others argue for enforcing stronger measures, stating that the government has an obligation to protect Canadians: it can and therefore it should. However, the government has not pursued further public health measures because it could also impair the Charter rights and freedoms of individual Canadians. This middle ground can be confusing. It is hard to discern the government's real ability to uphold our fundamental rights and freedoms. Can the Canadian government place limits on our Charter rights? The short answer is - yes. All three levels of Canadian government can use Section 1 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms to impose reasonable limits on Canadians' rights and freedoms. This is what gives the government the legal authority to mandate mask-wearing, which has become a lightning rod in the U.S. and for some in Canada. However, Michelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for human rights, has warned countries against using COVID-19 as an ""excuse for human rights violations."" This pandemic highlights three key issues affecting Canadians' Charter rights: Access to health care and employment COVID-19 disproportionately affects poor, racialized minorities, especially, women, living in Canadian cities, thus revealing how the pandemic exacerbates many longstanding social and economic inequalities. Both Statistics Canada and Public Health Ontario confirm that these groups experience more discriminatory and adverse effects of COVID-19. They face more risk because they often work frontline jobs, live in smaller and more crowded homes, and encounter barriers when accessing health information. Another StatsCan study says that their existing high poverty rates make them more vulnerable to the financial impact of work disruptions. Despite the absence of an explicit reference to socio-economic rights in the Charter, the right to equality (Section 15) and the right to ""life, liberty and security of the person"" (Section 7) and provincial human rights legislation together protect these people from any form of discrimination in health care and employment. But, public- and private-sector organizations must recognize their human rights obligations and consider the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on the vulnerable groups they employ or provide services. Availability of affordable housing COVID is rendering many Canadians homeless, as more people cannot pay their rent or access homeless shelters due to the spread of the virus within the shelter system. In Edmonton and Calgary, about 2,000-3,000 people are homeless - a figure that has risen dramatically since the pandemic began. Several hundred people now sleep outside every night in frigid weather. The end of provincial eviction bans, as of September, only makes this worse. And many provinces have also lifted the rent increase freeze. Tent cities keep emerging across Canadian cities, even though many municipalities have tried to help. Obviously, the cumulative effect of these changes will hit low-income renters hard in coming months. Unfortunately, housing is not a Charter-protected right in Canada. The federal government's new housing strategy is based on human rights, but it is not a constitutionally guaranteed right. However, it should be one. It is poor, racialized, or Indigenous people, people with disabilities, and others who are protected under Charter Section 15 or provincial human rights legislation who need or currently occupy affordable housing. Although not stated explicitly, the Alberta Human Rights Act and the Ontario Human Rights Code appear to suggest that they prohibit discrimination based on poverty, through key phrases like ""source of income"" or ""receipt of public assistance."" But, still, the poor remain unprotected and often unhoused. Restrictions on religious services COVID-19 has instigated constraints on gatherings at places of worship. These measures have affected two Charter freedoms - freedom to assembly and to practise religion. Although not as widespread as lawsuits contesting this in the U.S., a few B.C. church gatherings have defied provincial health directives. When fined, they questioned the validity of the law by citing their rights in Charter Section 2. The pandemic has certainly placed the Canadian government in a serious bind: how to maintain its obligation to keep Canadians safe while upholding its human rights obligations. It has added to our societal vulnerablities given that many Canadians are in precarious employment or housing situations, The pandemic has worsened the situation of many ethno-racial communities, many of which were already living on the verge of crisis. In a way, this pandemic is a wake-up call that our fundamental rights and freedoms can be so easily tested under trying circumstances. Without a deliberate and long-term commitment to human rights, any future adversities will further aggravate existing inequities and vulnerabilities in our society. At present, the government must prioritize Charter-protected groups in its COVID-19 vaccine rollout plan, putting them at the front of the line to be vaccinated: older people living alone or in institutions, Indigenous peoples, precarious workers, people experiencing poverty and homelessness, and people with disabilities.

"Alberta sees shift in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, resistance as rollout continues",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-alberta-sees-shift-in-covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy-resistance-as-rollout/,www.theglobeandmail.com,The shift shows that many people’s opinions on the COVID-19 vaccine are not rigid – an important understanding as we near the end of the first vaccine rollout,['Kelly Cryderman'],2021-05-21 19:58:23,"People line up outside an immunization clinic in Edmonton to get their Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine on April 20, 2021.JASON FRANSON/The Canadian Press If Alberta is starting to crawl out of an awful third wave of the pandemic, it's in part because provincial vaccine hesitancy and flat-out resistance have evolved with remarkable speed over the past six months. , when public-health officials are increasing their efforts to reach people who are indifferent, hesitant or resistant. Last November, one in four Albertans told the Angus Reid Institute they would not get a COVID-19 vaccination - nearly double the percentage of that in Ontario and British Columbia. The polling firm recorded the same percentage at a startling 36 per cent in Alberta in January. Another 9 per cent of Albertans said that month they weren't sure one way or the other. Canada vaccine tracker: How many COVID-19 doses have been administered so far? Am I eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine? The latest rules by province Coronavirus tracker: How many COVID-19 cases are there in Canada and worldwide? The latest maps and charts But today, the number of those across Canada who say they will not get the vaccine has dropped, significantly so in Alberta. The pollster said this week that 16 per cent of Albertans say they will not be vaccinated (a probability sample of this size would carry a margin of error of +/- three percentage points, 19 times out of 20). It's still higher than the national average - again about double the rate of both Ontario and B.C. - but the Alberta numbers are coming closer to those in the rest of the country. ""I can't express how happy I am that it has dropped, precipitously,"" said Cheryl Peters, an epidemiologist at the Cumming School of Medicine at the University of Calgary. With all the emphasis on vaccine hesitancy, it can be lost that most Albertans are keen on vaccines. More than 51 per cent of Albertan adults and teens have at least one dose, Chief Medical Officer of Health Deena Hinshaw said Thursday. That's on par with Friday's national rate of 49 per cent of Canadians having one dose. Alberta also has a high-for-Canadian-provinces rate of second shots or full vaccination, at 8 per cent. But months ago, there were more people in the province skeptical that COVID-19 was a serious public-health threat - a factor closely related to vaccine hesitancy or resistance - than there are now. Alberta has only in recent days been able to shake the unhappy status of having the highest infection rate in North America (the province is now second to Manitoba). Certainly some views have been changed by news of near-overwhelmed ICUs and delayed surgeries, or by personal acquaintance with someone who became ill with COVID-19. Vaccine hesitancy rates across the country have also gone down thanks to the ""seeing is believing"" trend, as Angus Reid Institute president Shachi Kurl describes it. Watching parents, grandparents and friends get the vaccine is a powerful motivator in both assuaging safety fears about vaccines, and increasing FOMO. ""Fear of missing out is a powerful emotion,"" Ms. Kurl said. Albertans have that, and they also have particularly close ties to family and colleagues in the western United States, where vaccines are widely available. And it's not lost that the U.S. is in a better position now because of near-universal availability of vaccines there. To be sure, there have been missteps in the vaccine messaging. Premier Jason Kenney has at times been overly solicitous to those who didn't want to get the vaccine. The fact that some United Conservative Party MLAs, some of whom were also opposed to broad health restrictions, haven't talked about getting the vaccine - even when specifically asked - is a stand for personal privacy but not a compelling demonstration of leadership. But the messaging that vaccines are the clear path out of restrictions seems to be getting through. Angus Reid pointed out vaccine uptake has been strong across the country despite deeply conflicting and confusing messages on the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine from federal bodies and political leaders. And research by The New York Times has found the best way to talk about vaccines with ""COVID skeptics"" - those who don't trust that the disease is serious and who believe unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about COVID-19 - is to emphasize that ""vaccination is their own, personal choice - one that can help them protect friends and family members."" To people who can't wait to get vaccinated, it's baffling that Mr. Kenney and other politicians have underscored the message of personal choice. But those words aren't for vaccine cheerleaders, they're for skeptics. Governments across Canada will soon have to decide how much effort to focus on the vaccine-hesitant or -resistant. Manitoba, for one, says it will announce a vaccine incentive program next week. The province seems to be taking a page from the U.S. states and cities offering cash and gift cards. Watch for a race to come up with the most creative vaccine gifts to become a thing here, as well. But the country is now on track to have supplies possibly sufficient to shorten the interval between the two shots. It's good for public health if more or most Canadians can be fully vaccinated in a much shorter timeline than planned. And it might be advantageous from a messaging point of view, too. As Ms. Kurl said, fear of being left out is a powerful motivator. Some skeptics changed their minds when they saw or read of vaccine successes in Israel, the U.S. and Britain. I saw more FOMO this month, when Alberta became the first province to announce it was offering the COVID-19 vaccinations to teenagers, too. If the vaccine-resistant see people getting their second jabs, and confidently eating at restaurants, or going to school and business openings - maybe even some day shedding their masks, or being able to travel - it might change their minds about the first shot.

Opinion: A 'No More Waves' strategy to help minimize the effects of COVID,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-a-no-more-waves-strategy-to-help-minimize-the-effects-of-covid,nationalpost.com,"Andrew Morris and Jack Mintz: Avoiding further waves is the best approach to manage health, economic and social risks","['Andrew Morris', 'Jack Mintz', 'Special To National Post']",2021-02-16 00:00:00,"Photo by GETTY IMAGES/THINKSTOCK In our December paper published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, we argued for a ""No More Waves"" strategy to follow an immediate period of strong suppression to keep the COVID-19 case count low. Our argument is based on balancing health, economic and social risks. It does not imply a zero-case count, but suggests keeping cases sufficiently low to stop further waves. Under this model, rather than going through economically costly yo-yos with incremental openings and lockdowns, communities would be able to open on an ongoing basis after an initial, sustained lockdown to suppress the virus and stop the spread. We know Canadians are getting tired of policies encroaching on their freedoms, but avoiding further waves is the best approach to manage health, economic and social risks. Below, we provide a compass to enable the relaxation of health rules and limit the possibility of another wave. Hospitalization and mortality counts have sadly risen over the past two months. Now we are starting to see some success after governments took actions in December to suppress the spread of the virus. Those restrictions are starting to come off recently, as case counts have dropped. However, it is too early to declare victory. Imported variants have already shown up in Canada, and they are more transmissible and possibly more deadly. Our vaccination program will optimistically lead to herd immunity by the fall, if vaccine delivery and distribution go as planned and vaccines remain effective against the circulating strains. None of this is a slam dunk, and new waves could easily appear beforehand. That makes our ""No More Waves"" strategy as relevant today as when we first proposed it before the winter holidays. This strategy includes three basic elements: (i) strengthened enforcement of health interventions to contain transmission; (ii) evidence-based reduction of gatherings based on transmission, social and economic risks; and (iii) ramping up infrastructure required for COVID-19 surveillance, screening and testing (including supporting wide-scale rapid testing) with accompanying contract tracing and isolation. Compared to the current mitigation strategy, a ""No More Waves"" strategy would reduce the overall need for prolonged lockdowns and economic, as well as social, hardship. Canada's four Atlantic provinces, which represent roughly seven per cent of Canada's population, originally pursued a maximum suppression strategy that later enabled people to have more freedom of movement without facing health risks. Importantly, the economic and social effects of the pandemic largely reflect the spread of the pandemic. Avoiding the exponential growth of cases, therefore, offers the best opportunity to preserve economic and social activity until vaccinations have been broadly administered. Although prolonged lockdowns are necessary when the realities of exponential growth have overwhelmed other non-pharmacologic interventions (NPIs), they are unneeded in regions where the incidence has not outstripped public health and health-care capacity. The choice of public health measures is determined by: a) the quality of the test-trace-isolate-support system; b) the rate of desired decline in cases; and c) the acceptability of the proposed public health measures. Different NPIs have different predicted effects. Whereas one jurisdiction may choose to go into lockdown for six weeks to drive cases to a low number as quickly as possible, another jurisdiction might choose to close restaurants, bars, fitness facilities and non-essential shopping for 10 weeks to achieve the same effect. The presence of new, highly transmissible variants likely change this calculus, but choosing the interventions should be based on local epidemiology, context and preferences, and should consider the health, economic and social impact of the interventions. We suggest prioritizing NPIs that are most likely to reduce the spread, while having a lower overall impact on economic and social well-being. Those NPIs that have high economic and social impacts but relatively low effects on transmission should be avoided. For example, we obviously were not going to close grocery and drug stores, given how essential they are, despite some health risk. Similarly, it is our contention that school closures, especially at the primary level, should be considered a last resort. As transmission falls, further steps can be made to open up economies such as low-density gym, manufacturing and retail business openings. Those interventions that have a large impact on transmission but have relatively small economic and social effects (e.g., universal masking and prohibitions on small indoor gatherings, non-essential travel and mass events), would be preferentially employed. Like most Canadians, we would like to have mass vaccination programs as soon as possible. We hope that new variants won't stop our progress in containing this woeful pandemic. Until we have medical interventions that predictably work, however, we counsel a ""No More Waves"" strategy to minimize health, economic and social risks as best as possible.

Opinion: Voter ID works in Canada. Why does Joe Biden want to banish it in the U.S.?,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-voter-id-works-in-canada-why-does-joe-biden-want-to-banish-it-in-the-u-s,nationalpost.com,"While Americans bicker over 'election security,' it may be worth their while to look northward to the Canadian example","['Arjun Singh', 'Special To National Post']",2021-07-15 00:00:00,"Photo by Brian Thompson/Postmedia News / Postmedia By Arjun Singh On Tuesday, Joe Biden accused Texas Republicans of being behind "" the most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War. "" In Texas, as with other states, GOP legislators convened to pass a law mandating voters show valid photo ID when they show up to vote. Democrats, meanwhile, packed up and flocked on private jets to Washington, D.C., to deny them quorum. Across America, ""voting rights"" have become the top political issue after the contested 2020 election. After courts dismissed their claims, states where results were challenged - Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin - have passed measures for election security, requiring photo ID to ensure that only eligible citizens vote. Eighty per cent of Americans, in a recent Monmouth University Poll, support these measures , with 69 per cent of Black voters endorsing the same . Though the U.S. Supreme Court recently upheld these laws, 6-3, in Arizona, Democrats are undeterred to ""stop the steal."" Their ‘For the People Act,' pending in Congress, would override state election security and end all ID requirements. So far, the Senate filibuster has prevented it from becoming law. While the U.S. bickers over ""election security,"" however, it may be worthwhile to look northward to the Canadian example. In 2007, with the Harper government's Bill C-31 amendments to the Elections Act, Canada made government-issued voter ID compulsory for federal elections (with provinces having similar measures). Voters, per Section 143, are required to prove their identity and residence, with strict requirements for the kinds of ID acceptable. Photo ID is the main type. Alternatively, voters require double ID - both proving their address - or must (along with another known voter) attest to their eligibility, which is confirmed later. To these rules, there are no exceptions - regardless of race, income or gender. 'Voting rights' have become the top political issue These measures have long been supported by Canadians and have been in place without issue. In 2019, during our most recent federal election, I was hired by Elections Canada to serve as Deputy Returning Officer for an inner-city Toronto riding. From dawn to dusk, my job was to verify voters' ID, monitor the ballot box, ensure ballot security and count the votes after the polls closed. The downtown riding spanned all socio-economic groups - from tony homes to homeless shelters and encampments - with many ethnic minorities. Regardless of their background or identity, every one of the voters I serviced presented valid voter ID to cast their ballot. Virtually all had government-issued photo ID showing their address - whether a driver's licence or another card - with the rest coming prepared with two documents to prove their eligibility. Young and old, poor or wealthy, these voters instinctively thought to bring ID with them to the ballot box. Just like driving a car or buying alcohol, they knew that voting must be safe and secure. Since these laws were made, and four federal elections later, there have never been accusations of ""widespread voter fraud"" or ""stolen elections"" on a national scale in Canada. Even in single contested cases, such as former Conservative MP Ted Opitz's six-vote victory in Etobicoke-Centre in 2011, nobody questioned voters' identification - though then-Liberal leader Bob Rae's conspiratorial claims that "" democracy was undermined "" would mirror Donald Trump today. When these voter ID laws were challenged on appeal in 2014 at the B.C. Court of Appeal, in Henry v. Canada (Attorney General), they were upheld unanimously. In her concurrence, Justice Daphne Smith found "" the objectives of preventing voter fraud and maintaining confidence in the electoral system to be pressing and substantial ."" More On This Topic Tasha Kheiriddin: Calling an election in August would give Trudeau Liberals best shot at a majority Rex Murphy: You thought lockdown was bad? Just wait until the next federal election In short, for over a decade, Canada has run its democracy smoothly with voter ID laws that keep our elections secure. Our insistence on using paper ballots for federal elections and allowing partisan election observers has helped bring in transparency and accountability, ensuring our elections are not compromised. Following Ronald Reagan, we Canadians ""trust, but verify."" As an economically, socially and culturally similar state, it thus beggars belief that Democrats in the United States won't adopt voter ID laws for election security. The idea that low-income ethnic minorities can't obtain proper ID - required for all the other business of life is, frankly ""fake news"" spewed by progressives and the mainstream media to alarm voters, and amounts to the soft bigotry of low expectations. Worse, amidst massive illegal immigration and election interference by Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, risks to voter integrity are greater than ever. Even the U.K. recognizes this, and has introduced new voter ID rules for protection . In these times, trying to loosen such laws is at odds with reality. If Joe Biden truly cares about ""facts,"" then the next time he speaks on voting rights, he'd do well to remember these.

"Opinion: We need a data-driven approach to fighting COVID-19, not a second lockdown",https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-we-need-a-data-driven-approach-to-fighting-covid-19-not-a-second-lockdown,nationalpost.com,Targeted public health responses can curb the rise in COVID-19 cases without shutting down entire communities,"['Dr. Isaac Bogoch', 'Goldy Hyder', 'National Post']",2020-09-21 00:00:00,"Photo by Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press By Dr. Isaac Bogoch and Goldy Hyder Canada has arrived at a critical moment in our national battle against COVID-19. Summer is over, many students are back in school, more and more employees are heading back to work. And in much of the country, COVID numbers are heading in the wrong direction. Over the past month the number of infections has risen steadily in B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, likely the beginning of a second wave. While this was somewhat predictable as more people gather in indoor settings, it is clearly vital to ensure the cases do not get out of control. Let's be clear: Canada cannot afford a second lockdown. The emotional and financial impact of physical distancing measures have exacted a heavy toll. In May more than half of respondents to a Statistics Canada online questionnaire reported worsening mental health. Unicef Canada has warned of a ""socioeconomic crisis"" affecting children through physical-distancing control measures. Across the country many thousands of small businesses have closed permanently, while others are hanging on by a thread. Let's be clear: Canada cannot afford a second lockdown Since the beginning of the pandemic we have emphasized three Cs: a consistent approach to dealing with the virus, clarity around public health guidelines, and compliance with those rules to keep the virus in check. To those we can add one more C: context. While case numbers and trends are important, contextualizing those numbers is equally important. Let's put to work the local and global knowledge we have gained over the past eight months. Yes, individuals need to wear masks in indoor public places, maintain two-metre distancing wherever possible, and follow other local public health guidelines. But they also need much more information than they are currently receiving. Public health agencies should be more transparent about where outbreaks are occurring in communities to help inform the general public. Do today's numbers represent new outbreaks or existing ones? Is the source of infection known or unknown? How efficiently is contact-tracing taking place? Who is getting infected and where? What can we learn from these outbreaks? Photo by Cole Burston/Bloomberg Rather than lockdowns, it is not too late for data-driven and targeted public health responses to curb the rise in COVID-19 cases. So how can we best contain the outbreaks we are seeing? First, we need to focus on where the outbreaks are occurring and what is driving them, and we need high-quality data to so. Is it a long-term care home? A private party? An apartment building? A bar? Each of those examples requires a different public health response. By drilling down on the source of infection, public health officials can target outbreaks with appropriate interventions without shutting down entire communities. We need to focus on where the outbreaks are occurring Second, our battle against the virus has demonstrated the importance of robust testing and tracing. The sooner test results are available, the faster contact tracing can occur, and the faster outbreaks can be contained. We are still failing on this score. As Dr. David Naylor, co-chair of Canada's COVID-19 Immunity Task Force recently noted, ""We need to have our A-game here in testing and tracing."" That means significantly increased testing capacity (including early detections systems within at-risk groups), and faster results, with positive cases rapidly linked to effective contact tracing. And for those who may not have the resources to self isolate safely, safe havens to recover where people will not infect others . Employers also have a role to play. As more people return to the workplace, businesses must create safe working environments for their employees and their clients. After all, the best economic stimulus is a healthy population. We can avoid a second lockdown by adhering to public health recommendations and making use of high-quality data to improve our understanding of who is getting infected, when and where. Share information, learn from experience, pay close attention to the context - and stay vigilant. Isaac Bogoch MD is an infectious disease specialist at Toronto General Hospital.

We now must recalibrate our goals and expectations during this pre-vaccine era to a world living with COVID-19 Photo by Graham Hughes / The Canadian Press By Dr. Sumon Chakrabarti, Dr. Zain Chagla and Dr. Isaac Bogoch We have now endured close to seven months of this pandemic, the likes of which almost no one in the world has seen in their lifetime. In this short period of time, we have seen staggering developments on the research front - knowledge that continues to accumulate to this day. Looking back to March when much of Canada entered a lockdown, though things have not been perfect, our overall response was successful. We now have very low levels of disease transmission across the country, and are currently in the midst of a slow, deliberate return to something closer to normalcy. This process is a complicated one, which at times may result in us having to re-evaluate our progress. At this phase in the outbreak it is safe to say we have passed the first wave. We now must recalibrate our goals and expectations during this pre-vaccine era to a world living with COVID-19, albeit one where we continue to strive to keep rates of infection as low as possible in community settings. There are four important concepts to consider in the coming months. The Hammer and the Dance Tomás Pueyo wrote a prescient article in March referring to a phased approach to controlling and maintaining the outbreak that he called ""The Hammer and the Dance."" The ""hammer"" aims to get the rate of COVID-19 transmission as low as possible, as quickly as possible, accomplished through the lockdown imposed back in March. This eventually worked, bringing us to low levels of disease transmission across the country. We are currently in the ""dance"" phase where the goal is to preserve this low transmission, aiming for a reproductive ""Rt"" rate (how many people on average an infected person passes the virus to) below one. Photo by Elliot Ferguson/The Whig-Standard/Postmedia Network Here, we dance with the virus by closely monitoring transmission, responding to outbreaks quickly to quell the small fires before they become big ones, and apply future policy based on the lessons learned from these events. During this ""dance"" phase, we should expect outbreaks. They will happen. Rapid identification of these is a sign that our system is working. Take for instance the recent outbreak at a nail salon in Kingston, Ont. Public health quickly reacted to the outbreak, with rapid case detection, contact tracing and focused isolation. Outbreak control was swift and effective. This process of rapidly responding to outbreaks is used by countries that have successfully managed their epidemics and have the infection under relatively good control. With early detection systems, and sufficient testing capacity, we are afforded the ability to identify outbreaks early, and if needed, reintroduce public health measures with precision, rather than globally. Remember the Big Picture Across Canada, there are news reports giving us daily COVID-19 case counts. More often than not, words like ""spike,"" ""uptick"" and ""surge"" are deployed when there are more cases today than yesterday, and ""plummet,"" ""dip"" and ""drop"" when fewer. These terms provoke undue anxiety or relief, but in reality all miss the big picture. Like the stock market, a clearer idea is obtained by looking at the longer-term trends, such as seven-day averages, in addition to other metrics. Whether there are 170 cases today, 130 tomorrow and 190 the day after does not matter as much as the fact that this is lower than the 400 cases a day from a month earlier. The situation has greatly improved in Canada with each successive month, and this is only appreciated when looking past the proverbial trees to the forest. Photo by Graham Hughes / The Canadian Press This is where the Rt rate is a useful metric. The goal is to keep this number at or below one to ensure cases are stable or declining over time, and at present, this is where we are in most of Canada. This value, however, can be misleading when there are a low number of cases. As the number of cases decrease below a certain threshold, small changes result in relatively large swings of the Rt, which leads to anxiety around explosive growth in localized regions. Once again, it is important to not look at one value in isolation; rather a compilation of metrics over time to gain a more holistic and accurate picture. Explosive growth does not happen overnight On Feb. 18, in northern Italy, the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in a healthy 38-year-old male. He was dubbed ""Patient 1."" A short time thereafter, this area of Italy experienced an explosion of COVID-19 cases that overwhelmed the health-care system, sickened thousands of people including hundreds of health-care workers, and took weeks to get under control. Looking closer, Patient 1 was more likely Patient 100, or possibly Patient 1,000. When all eyes were on China in early 2020, COVID-19 was already circulating in northern Italy. It took weeks of undetected (and therefore uncontrolled) spread before the country was in the grips of the explosive epidemic growth. By that point, even with extreme measures such as a lockdown, things got a lot worse before they eventually got better. Photo by Marco Alpozzi/LaPresse In Canada, our measures, including the lockdown, were able to largely avoid this terrible scenario, but there is still fear it could happen if we get complacent with our public-health measures such as physical distancing, indoor mask wearing and good hand hygiene. This concern has been magnified across the country in the last few weeks, with multiple regions relaxing restrictions along with increasing outbreak clusters. These clusters, however, do not progress to exponential growth overnight. To have a scenario akin to what happened in northern Italy or New York City, you would need weeks of uncontrolled spread. With our current testing capacity and availability, as well our ability to track, trace and isolate clusters, this is an unlikely scenario here in Canada. We may get clusters of infection and provinces may even need to walk back on some of the reopening plans if there are a large number of cases, but this would happen long before we ever get to a situation of exponential growth overwhelming our health-care systems. Nevertheless, it is imperative to continue practising the principles of COVID-19 prevention including physical distancing, good hand hygiene and masks in indoor public places. Low community transmission means a lower risk for everyone Dr. Mike Ryan of the World Health Organization recently, and very insightfully, remarked that the best way we can protect people against COVID-19 is by having low community transmission. This obvious point cannot be emphasized enough. When there is a low burden of COVID-19 in a given area, the risk of acquisition will be substantially reduced for everyone, and for every activity. It is only under these low-burden circumstances where allowing higher-risk venues (such as schools, indoor dining, bars, etc.) to even be considered for reopening. Photo by JONATHAN NACKSTRAND/AFP These decisions, given the protection from low prevalence environments, cannot be applied in a subjective manner. Evenly distributed as well as evidence-based infection and control policies should be applied to most settings with a goal to give institutions and businesses a chance to open up safely while community transmission is low. Today in Canada, the chance you have of contracting COVID-19 in the community, though not zero, is the lowest it has been since the start of the pandemic. This is the time to arm ourselves with the power and courage to cautiously lift restrictions on higher-risk activities, without descending into an explosion of cases, with the understanding that this reopening may be reversed if (or when) case numbers rise. A Final Thought By this point, it should come as no shock that COVID-19 will be a significant part of our everyday lives for some time to come. Many things have changed in a dramatic way, and some may never be the same again. A vaccine and/or effective treatment cannot come soon enough. Canadians have come together at great personal sacrifice to endure a lockdown, and ultimately the first phase was successful. There is a very understandable reluctance to lift restrictions for fear of a resurgence, but if anything, now is the time to do it with careful planning and monitoring, and with a goal to keep community cases as low as possible. More On This Topic As young people come out of lockdown, Canada is seeing a spike in COVID-19 cases Nearly three out of four Canadians say virtual conferencing tools an 'excellent' alternative to interacting in person Rollout of Canada's 'COVID Alert' app criticized over download requirements There will be a continual ebb and flow of COVID-19 cases in the coming months. The so-called dance allows us to adapt with the circumstances, including safeguards to prevent infection rates from spiralling out of control. To do this successfully we must continue to look towards the long-term trends and recalibrate our expectations on what is to come.

"Opinion: As campuses reopen, international students need our support",https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/opinion-as-campuses-reopen-international-students-need-our-support,montrealgazette.com,Government and educational institutions must step up to ensure the well-being of these students after going through an extra-difficult time.,['Ezgi Ozyonum'],2021-08-07 00:00:00,"Government and educational institutions must step up to ensure the well-being of these students after going through an extra-difficult time. Photo by Dave Sidaway / Montreal Gazette Montreal universities have announced that students will return to campus for in-person classes this September. While it is not yet known what impact the fourth wave of COVID-19 and vaccine passport discussions will have, all indications are that Canada will welcome more international students than last year . Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada reported a 17-per-cent decline in international students' enrolment in 2020 because of the pandemic. In 2018, international students' economic contributions were valued at $21.6 billion, leading many to wonder how Canadian universities and colleges would survive without their financial support. While this concern might be valid, using a solely financial lens overlooks the tremendous cultural diversity these students bring to every community. A more proactive question to ask is: How can we better serve international students so that Canada attracts more international enrolment? International students have experienced physically, financially and emotionally challenging obstacles during this pandemic. Some had to pack up and fly home in a single day after being notified about the closure of their dorms and countries' borders. Other students were prevented from entering Canada, requiring them to carry out their studies in a different time zone. Imagine paying four times the domestic tuition rate only to have to wake up daily at 4 a.m. to attend online classes. Studying under these circumstances brought on by the pandemic will have a lasting impact on the psychological and emotional well-being of international students, on top of the obstacles they more commonly faced before. My research has shown that international students experience greater anxiety and isolation than domestic students, while having access to less social support. Adapting to new academic and living environments is challenging and they often need institutional support to deal with the culture shock. Educational institutions should become more mindful of this vulnerable population and promote such appropriate accommodations as academic counselling, peer support study groups and student mental health services, where possible. As a short-term plan, government and educational institutions should consider how to welcome international students by prioritizing their safety during and after their journey to Canada. They might need to arrive early to self-isolate if they are not fully vaccinated or their COVID-19 vaccines are not approved by Canadian authorities . If they get sick during their travel, they might not have access to health insurance before the official start date of their program. All universities and colleges should offer quarantine packages and health resources. If some international students cannot come to Canada due to delays in obtaining study permits or travel restrictions , educational institutions should be prepared to offer alternatives, such as allowing them to start their program remotely. As a long-term plan, universities and colleges should build support teams to counter the isolation and hold networking activities to accommodate the unique social needs of international students. Mobilizing mentors or fellow students might help them to better handle their culture shock. Finally, both government and universities should play a substantial role in removing any financial burdens. As an international graduate student, I am aware that there are many federal funding opportunities (e.g. SSHRC, NSERC, etc.) not available to international students. In 2017, Quebec has removed barriers of citizenship or permanent residence status in application requirements to its provincial research fund (FRQSC, FRQNT, etc.). Similar changes can be put into action by the federal government. All students in Canada should have access to these grants and scholarships, especially as they contribute so much both during and after their studies to the Canadian economic and social life.

The year has transformed our lives in very significant and difficult ways. The loss of friends and family members to the virus, absence of social contact, ever-present fear of getting sick and challenges to our general mental health have made life very difficult. At the beginning of the pandemic, much attention was paid to those whose work involved significant risk. Health-care workers were considered ""heroes"" and their contributions were regularly recognized. It soon became clear that COVID-19 was not going to disappear quickly and the restrictions we all faced led to ""pandemic fatigue."" The focus inevitably and understandably went from acknowledging those working on the front lines to personal survival. Data and research show that those working in hospitals, clinics, long-term care facilities and other health-care environments are indeed among those at higher risk of catching the virus and giving it to others. They are not able to work from home, engage in social distancing, or limit contact to small social bubbles. Each day, they go home from work wondering if this is the day they could get the virus and bring it home to their families. Medical radiation technologists, or MRTs for short, continue to be some of the most at-risk health-care workers. If you have ever had an X-ray, a CT scan, an MRI, or radiation therapy as part of your cancer treatment, you've seen an MRT. You probably did not know they were called MRTs. They know and have come to expect this. The pandemic has revealed something far more concerning: many in important decision-making roles such as ministers of health, senior policymakers and even those running hospitals also do not know who MRTs are and what they do. Which is why MRTs had to fight for access to the protective gear that doctors and nurses were given without a thought. It is also why MRTs were not prioritized in many provincial vaccination rollout plans. Across Canada, health-care providers are now receiving their first or second dose of the vaccine. A survey conducted by the Canadian Association of Medical Radiation Technologists (CAMRT) this month revealed that vaccines have been given to 90 per cent of MRTs in Manitoba, 80 per cent in British Columbia, and 68 per cent in Ontario have received at least one dose of vaccine. MRTs are rightly breathing a sigh of relief after a year of relentless pressure and uncertainty. But not in Alberta. In Alberta, the number of MRTs having received a jab less than five per cent at the time of writing. Yes, you read that correctly: less than five per cent. And yet, most, if not all, people confirmed to have COVID-19 have chest X-rays taken by MRTs. MRTs are in contact with virtually all people testing positive for the novel coronavirus; it is hard to imagine that anyone could argue that this is not a dangerous profession at the moment. How has the Alberta government not recognized this dangerous oversight? Are Alberta MRTs somehow magically at lower risk than those working in other provinces? Are vulnerable patients less likely to contract COVID-19 from an MRT in Alberta who contracts the virus because they have not been vaccinated? Of course not. The implementation of the Government of Alberta's vaccine rollout plan is not working. Frontline professionals with exposure to COVID-19, like MRTs, must be vaccinated now. I have written to the Alberta minister of health twice in my capacity as CEO of the CAMRT. I have received no response. The 2,300 MRTs in the province are being overlooked and ignored. They deserve better. Albertans deserve better. I sincerely hope that exposing this fact in a public way will catch the minister's attention and convince his office to take action. Lives depend on it.

It…,['Ryan Stelter'],2020-10-10 00:00:00,"Would a northwestern Ontario bubble prevent the rising number of COVID-19 infections in Toronto and Manitoba to arrive in our plot of the Canadian Shield? It sounds crazy, but we're not that far away. I was scrolling through social media the other day and saw an interesting idea from Red Lake physician Dr. Lisa Habermehl, which was to create a northwestern Ontario bubble, much like the Atlantic provinces did at the onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic. The bubble essentially requires anyone travelling from out of province to self-isolate for 14 days. There are exceptions of course, but the Atlantic provinces have been doing well in terms of case numbers, and so has the northwest. Yes, those nine cases in one day were certainly scary and was a reminder that we are not immune out here. Astonishingly, we have not seen any more positives come out of that situation yet. The Northwestern Health Unit feared there could be community transmission of the virus in Kenora, but so far, so good. I will knock on wood for all of us, however. With clowns to the left of us (Manitoba) and jokers to the right (Greater Toronto Area) we truly are stuck in the middle being in the northwest. A viable solution could be to limit interprovincial and even intra-provincial travel to prevent people from coming in and bringing the virus to our small towns. People could still come to the region but would have to isolate upon arrival in this bubble concept. There would be a lot that would go into having that kind of bubble, and it has its flaws, effectively cutting us off from the rest of the country. Many people have family in Winnipeg and southern Ontario, but the health unit is already telling us to avoid nonessential travel out of northern Ontario, which is a wise thing to be doing given the skyrocketing cases in Toronto and Winnipeg. I am not advocating for a border shutdown between Manitoba and Ontario, that would be asinine. I recognize that the Trans-Canada Highway exists and the northwest is a vital link to the rest of the country; I also know that many Winnipeg companies conduct business in the region. This bubble idea doesn't have to be permanent, but until things settle down in the surrounding areas, it may be prudent to do it. Perhaps the health unit could mandate people coming from out of the province to self-isolate for 14 days upon their arrival. They are advising people to self-monitor for 14 days and to isolate if symptoms develop when travelling out of province. They also advise people to self-isolate if they come in contact with a case or known outbreak, which should be fairly obvious at this point. People should already just stay home and avoid nonessential travel, no matter where they are in the country anyway. Atlantic Canada has geography on its side, making a bubble concept easier but it could be done in the northwest. Premier Doug Ford and his chief medical officer Dr. David Williams have been raked over the coals for their response to the rising cases and mixed messaging lately. Ford did praise the north for how well we are doing amidst the pandemic, which is nice but I would like to see him help us out by telling the south to avoid heading up here. Cases may still creep up into Kenora and the surrounding area, but we have done well so far. We got lulled into a false sense of security over the summer, but now is not the time to give up just because ""you're sick of it."" Newsflash: we're all sick of this stupid virus, but it's our new reality and we have to live with it. Let's remain vigilant and not be dumb about this, things could go south here fast if we start to think we're invincible. Winnipeg is a good example, they moved into a fourth phase of reopening in July and their cases have not stopped climbing since. We've been fortunate that since moving into the third phase of reopening we have not seen that type of spike. People say there has to be a balance between living with the virus and imposing restrictions, and I'm here to tell you that I do not have those answers. Clearly, restrictions worked. Take the situation in western Manitoba - cases were getting out of hand so the province imposed restrictions and two weeks later, cases started going down and they were allowed to have somewhat normal life come back. If that's the strategy moving forward, I can deal with that. For now, remember to practice good hand hygiene, don't touch your face in public and wear your damn mask properly. I, along with all of you, am dreaming of the day I never have to hear the term ""physical distancing"" again. We'll get through it. News Near Kenora"
Opinion: Why we need a national contact-tracing app,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-why-we-need-a-national-contact-tracing-app,nationalpost.com,"Senators Colin Deacon, Rosemary Moodie and Judith Seidman: It's imperative that politicians and public health officials in all provinces work together in…","['Colin Deacon', 'Rosemary Moodie', 'Judith Seidman', 'Special To National Post']",2020-06-16 00:00:00,"Senators Colin Deacon, Rosemary Moodie and Judith Seidman: It's imperative that politicians and public health officials in all provinces work together in advance of a second wave of COVID-19 to encourage the widespread adoption of one national exposure notification app Photo by Catherine LAI/AFP The COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented threat to our collective physical, mental and economic health. To date, over 8,000 Canadians have lost their lives, 8.4 million have accessed emergency income supports, countless businesses have had their viability threatened and our 2021 federal budget deficit will likely exceed $250 billion - increasing our total federal debt by 35 per cent in just one year. Governments and businesses are working to ensure that Canadians can safely get back to work in the face of the ongoing coronavirus threat. The importance of these efforts is magnified by the prospect of a second wave of COVID-19 arriving before we have a vaccine. That's why we're advocating for digital contact tracing to be used to augment traditional infection control methods across Canada. In the absence of an effective treatment or vaccine, our only defences are regular and vigorous hand washing, social distancing, testing, contact tracing, self-isolation and quarantining. A recent survey commissioned by several senators found that over 90 per cent of Canadians agree that these efforts are critical to controlling the spread of COVID-19. Photo by Heiko Junge/NTB Scanpix/AFP The all-important process of contact tracing and notifying people who may have been exposed is labour intensive and subject to several practical limitations. A public health worker must interview each person who tests positive to find everyone that person might have infected. Success depends on those who test positive remembering, and willingly disclosing, every contact. Public health officials then get on the phone to find and notify each person on that list. Canadians know that exposure notification is important. The senators' survey found that 82 per cent of Canadians want to be automatically notified if they are exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 and 92 per cent want others to be automatically notified if they test positive. An exposure notification app can enable complete and speedy notification, while limiting the amount of private information that must be disclosed. This is because recent software designs keep the contact data on the user's phone until, with the user's permission, public health officials trigger the anonymous digital notification of all those who came into close proximity with the infected person over a certain period of time. This differs from most commercial apps that transfer location information to centralized servers. Photo by Fabrice COFFRINI/AFP Wide adoption of an exposure notification app among the 87 per cent of Canadians who have smartphones would strengthen traditional public health efforts. However, these apps have been launched in several countries and some have had lacklustre results. In early April, Iceland introduced an app just as it flattened its curve. It had limited effect because it was downloaded by only 38 per cent of the population. Singapore was even lower, at 20 per cent. Just like a vaccine, an app requires a high level of adoption to provide the greatest benefits, but, unlike a vaccine, an exposure notification app is available today. Additionally, it was concerning that only 63 per cent of Canadians said that they would take a vaccine without hesitation once it's available. A recent Journal of the American Medical Association article argued that the COVID-19 pandemic could be suppressed if traditional methods were augmented by at least 56 per cent of the population using one contact-tracing app. If governments in Canada co-operate and focus their efforts on the adoption of one national contact-tracing app, they'll find a lot of talented entrepreneurs who are willing to help earn the public's trust. Photo by Paresh Dave/Reuters Recently, Health Minister Patty Hajdu told reporters that ""some jurisdictions prefer"" that contact tracing be done ""the old-fashioned way."" That's worrisome given recent data showing that 46 per cent of COVID-19 transmissions occur pre-symptomatically, meaning before the individual would normally get tested. The authors concluded that supplementing traditional contact tracing with digital apps was an essential prevention measure. In the words of Dr. Michael Warner, medical director of critical care at Michael Garron Hospital in Toronto, ""every minute counts"" when tracking down the contacts of people infected with COVID-19. That's why it's imperative that politicians and public health officials in all provinces work together in advance of a second wave of COVID-19, to encourage the widespread adoption of one national exposure notification app to augment traditional contact-tracing efforts.

"Opinion: Now, it's our generation's turn to step up",https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/opinion-now-its-our-generations-turn-to-step-up,montrealgazette.com,"Today’s public health emergency, and how governments and citizens respond to it, will be a catalyst for a transformed society.",['Christopher Holcroft'],2020-04-25 00:00:00,"Photo by Allen McInnis / Montreal Gazette I am thinking a lot about my grandparents these days. Their generation not only survived the Great Depression and Second World War, they triumphed; building a country that was more peaceful, prosperous and just than the one they had known before. They did so through sacrifice and solidarity. Likewise, today's public health emergency, and how governments and citizens respond to it, will be a catalyst for a transformed society. To survive and triumph, we must maintain and strengthen civic trust. We should not underestimate the scale of this challenge. The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to harm a large number of Quebecers and Canadians. Among other strategies, public health officials and government leaders are pleading with citizens to practise physical distancing. This measure represents an unprecedented disruption to daily life in peace time. The threat of the pandemic combined with the severe limiting of social interactions is an immense strain on even the most stoic of individuals, and the potential for long-term mental health consequences is deeply troubling. To facilitate and enforce physical distancing, much commercial activity has ceased and governments have placed significant restrictions on the movement of citizens. All of these developments are accompanied by extraordinary risks. The shutdown of our economy has had a disproportionate impact on vulnerable Canadians, and the projected recession threatens to deepen income inequality. State restrictions on individual freedom, even those made in the inarguable interest of the public good, could end up aiding those who practise what pollster Frank Graves calls "" authoritarian populism. "" The potential frailty of a post-pandemic society may be further exacerbated by whatever dominant narrative takes hold upon the containment of the virus. Overcoming misinformation and escaping a perception of failure if fatalities soar or overreaction if they do not may prove difficult and have disastrous consequences for public trust in science, evidence and institutions. Fortunately, civic trust so far appears to be holding and a majority of us say we are following the advice of public health officials. Yet Canada is not entirely insulated from the forces of division and exploitation. An eco-system of alt-right media and activists are using concerns over traveller transmission of the virus to perpetuate anti-refugee rhetoric; the gun industry is benefitting from unfounded fears of civil unrest; oil companies are trying to leverage the pandemic to escape the carbon tax, the centre of the country's climate change plan; and there is a growing chorus of voices attacking public health evidence. We cannot tolerate ignorance peddlers and panic profiteers dissuading us from common sense and the common good. Recognizing that our own ability to evade the virus is partially dependent on the diligence of those we have been arguing with on social media is sobering. It is why civility, patience and solidarity are imperative in this moment. So rather than raising voices and pointing fingers, let us imagine a better future. For example, what if we could use this necessary pause to re-evaluate how we prioritize work and family, profit and service, individualism and community, and develop public policies to reflect a better equilibrium? What if we could leverage our renewed reliance on public health evidence to declare the information age the era of science and reason, and usher in exciting new possibilities for solving societal problems? What if we could admit to, and then reject, the extreme inequities in our economic system and build a more just society? Finally, what if we could ensure that the clearer skies and cleaner air we are experiencing continue by developing a new industrial strategy that protected our environment and mitigated climate change? This is the future Canada could have, if we pull together now, if we resolve to survive and triumph in our own moment of history through sacrifice and solidarity. It could be the legacy we leave for our grandchildren.

British Columbia looks to create its own pandemic bubble,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-british-columbia-looks-to-create-its-own-pandemic-bubble/,www.theglobeandmail.com,Province seeks legal opinion on whether it can limit visitors from the rest of Canada,['Justine Hunter'],2021-01-14 21:42:08,"Businesses have started putting up signs welcoming traveling Albertans back to the small town of Radium Hot Springs, B.C., June 29, 2020.TODD KOROL/The Globe and Mail The B.C. government is reviewing legal advice on whether it can restrict non-essential travel across provincial boundaries as frustrations mount about non-resident visitors who ignore requests to stay home to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Premier John Horgan said his cabinet is considering the legal opinion it has received and he expects to make an announcement early next week. B.C. would be the largest province to impose restrictions on interprovincial travellers, an extraordinary step in the fight to contain the pandemic. The Atlantic provinces have maintained restrictions for non-residents for months, requiring all non-essential visitors to quarantine for two weeks. Pandemic travel restrictions imposed by the Newfoundland and Labrador government also survived a Charter challenge. Since November, as the second wave of the pandemic accelerated, the Provincial Health Officer has advised B.C. residents not to travel for vacations or to visit friends or family outside of their household or core bubble. The Premier said he is responding to public concern ""about people coming from elsewhere when they're making sacrifices of their own,"" he said. Since the arrival of the pandemic early in 2020, Mr. Horgan has said Canadians have Charter-protected mobility rights within the country, and closing the province to other Canadians was initially dismissed as impractical, in part because of the large number of Albertans who own recreational property in B.C. B.C. has not spelled out whether it would prefer restrictions on who can enter, quarantine requirements, or other measures. Mr. Horgan told reporters on Thursday that public anger has been stoked by politicians and other public figures who travelled out of the country over Christmas. While no members of B.C.'s legislative assembly left the province over the holidays, he said, the stories ""led to a firestorm of frustration and anger, because Canadians and British Columbians are making sacrifices, and one of those sacrifices is staying close to home, not travelling to see loved ones, not going to tend to what would have been traditions, or pressing matters; the loss of life of a loved one in another part of the country."" The Premier expressed frustration that directions from provincial and territorial leaders to discourage non-essential travel around the country have been ineffective. ""It would seem an easy thing to do to just tell people not to come here,"" he said. B.C. has been a destination for Canadian travellers this winter, including thousands of so-called snowbirds who were discouraged from going to the United States for the winter because of international travel restrictions. The Canadian Camping and RV Council has helped secure about 5,000 RV camping locations for Canadians on Vancouver Island and around the lower mainland. The organization's executive director, Shane Devenish, said in an interview that his organization would oppose any attempt to curb cross-country travel. ""Officially, we would be against that. I understand what they are trying to do, but the freedom for RVers to go from one province to another is important,"" Mr. Devenish said. ""We will follow that closely, British Columbia being such a popular destination."" Canada's four Atlantic provinces have had barriers to non-essential travel from other parts of the country since the pandemic began. Those restrictions, requiring two weeks of self-isolation upon entrance, have helped the region keep case numbers among the lowest in the developed world - but have also come at great cost to industries connected to travel. Until November, residents of Atlantic Canada could travel freely among the four provinces without needing to quarantine. That agreement, called the Atlantic Bubble, ended when cases in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick began to rise. Cara Zwibel, a lawyer for the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, said B.C. will have to tread carefully, and suggested that it should seek the least restrictive measures to achieve its objectives. ""It's certainly been the recommendations throughout much of this [pandemic] that people shouldn't be travelling around for non-essential reasons,"" she said. ""I understand the reasoning behind it, and the desire of governments to try to curb that one potential source of new infections and transmission. But I do believe that the Charter protects the rights of Canadians to move freely within the country."" The association launched a Charter challenge last year to Newfoundland and Labrador's travel restrictions on behalf of Nova Scotian Kimberley Taylor, who was denied entry to attend her mother's funeral. The provincial Supreme Court upheld the travel restriction, confirming that Ms. Taylor's Charter right to mobility within Canada was infringed, but it ruled that infringement was justified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The civil liberties group intends to appeal. Constitutional expert Errol Mendes, a law professor at the University of Ottawa, said B.C. can expect a Charter challenge if it attempts to impose travel restrictions on Canadians outside its boundaries, but it could defend limits if it can demonstrate that those infringements are reasonable to protect public health. ""The onus will be on the government to show compelling evidence,"" he said. The Newfoundland and Labrador government presented modelling to show the court that COVID-19 would spread faster without travel restrictions, and that the biggest risk to the province was the introduction of the disease from other jurisdictions. It also argued that its limited health care resources - just 92 intensive care unit beds - means that a surge in cases would put the health care system in jeopardy. Prof. Mendes said British Columbia would have to provide its own scientific and health data to establish a similar risk.

Opinion: Schools need health measures in place to combat Delta variant,https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-school-divisions-need-to-have-some-health-measures-in-place-to-combat-delta-variant,leaderpost.com,"We have enough shared experience to know the challenge Delta poses and how we must respond, write Dr. Carla Holinaty and Dr. Alexander Wong.","['Dr. Alexander Wong', 'Dr. Carla Holinaty']",2021-05-26 00:00:00,"Opinion: School divisions need to have some health measures in place to combat Delta variant Opinion: School divisions need to have some health measures in place to combat Delta variant Photo by BRANDON HARDER / Regina Leader-Post As September approaches, children and families in Saskatchewan are turning their attention to the new school year. While school supplies and new clothes remain part of the back-to-school tradition, this year the return to in-class learning will also coincide with a significant rise in cases of COVID-19 in Saskatchewan from the Delta variant. Parents are anxiously waiting to hear from their school divisions as to the safety protocols that will be in place when school begins. The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 is a very different virus than what our province has previously faced. It is 55 per cent more transmissible than the Alpha variant which caused a surge of cases this spring, and twice as transmissible as the ancestral strain we faced in 2020. With the rise in cases, Saskatchewan has seen the first two weeks of August, particularly in Saskatoon, there is no question that our fourth wave of COVID-19 has begun. Opinion: School divisions need to have some health measures in place to combat Delta variant The impact of the pandemic thus far on children and adolescents as a result of school restrictions has been uniformly negative, with downstream impacts on parents and families. Experts in pediatrics and public health universally agree that in-class learning and in-person school attendance must be prioritized at nearly any cost, and school closures with remote learning must only be a measure of last resort to control a pandemic surge. Delta is now surging in parts of the southern United States . Children and school staff are being infected and quarantined at remarkable rates. Given that the risk of in-school transmission of Delta increases as community transmission rates rise, these outcomes are not surprising, especially in the absence of universal mitigating measures such as masks. Although Saskatchewan's vaccine uptake is better than the worst-affected parts of the United States, given the limited public health measures currently in place in our province, we expect a surge of cases from Delta soon. When this occurs, the transmission risk in Saskatchewan schools will increase accordingly. Saskatchewan was relatively fortunate during the 2020-21 school year. Solid evidence-based safety protocols were in place, including universal masking, physical distancing, daily symptom checks, stay-at-home protocols and liberal testing combined with timely contact tracing. School closures were limited. Despite vaccines for COVID-19 not being available most of the 2020-21 school year, limited in-school transmission of COVID-19 occurred. According to an epidemiologic analysis released by the Saskatchewan Health Authority in late May to inform decision-making for Regina-area schools, of 1,299 cases identified as being school-associated in Regina, only about 10 per cent of these were most likely acquired in the school setting. This strongly suggests that control measures in schools during the 2020-21 school year worked very well to limit transmission of COVID-19. There is no justification for not doing everything to protect Saskatchewan children and schools through the entirety of the 2021-22 school year. There are more than 180,000 children under the age of 12 in Saskatchewan who remain ineligible for vaccine , a reality which will not change until likely sometime this winter. Returning to in-class learning with no safety measures in place other than for enhanced cleaning protocols would mean that nearly all children involved in in-class learning would be exposed to Delta, and many (especially those under age 12 who remain unvaccinated) would be infected. While most children do not develop severe illness even with Delta, a small number will require hospitalization and critical care support, a smaller number may die. Even if we chose to heartlessly trivialize this reality, we would still not be considering the significant impact of illness and disability on children and their families, the trauma induced through medical care, or short- and long-term mental health effects. Local medical health officers (MHOs) have been tasked through the pandemic with the responsibility of providing recommendations to teachers, educational leaders and school divisions regarding appropriate safety measures and protocols based on local epidemiologic trends. While we await further guidance from the ministries of Education and Health, that responsibility continues into the 2021-22 school year. As we trust our teachers and educational leaders implicitly to provide the best approaches to teaching our children, we must also trust our local MHOs who are experts in providing the necessary guidance to keep schools open and our children safe throughout the pandemic. The evidence for keeping schools safe includes universal masking, distancing and cohorting as able, improved ventilation for teaching settings that have yet to do so, and zero-barrier access to vaccination for all who are eligible, including family members. We are confident the recommendations from local MHOs will be clear, unambiguous, and follow the best science currently available. We are both parents of young children who attend daycares and schools in Saskatchewan, and we both see no present issue more important than protecting the safety of our province's children and keeping our province's schools open for in-class learning as much as possible. We remind all Saskatchewan citizens to do their part by getting fully vaccinated in order to limit community transmission of Delta, which in turn will limit in-school transmission of Delta. We ask our teachers, educational leaders, and school divisions to follow the recommendations of their local MHOs to provide the safest learning environment possible. To use an educational analogy, we feel much of this is similar to getting the correct answers in advance of the test. We have enough shared experience in Saskatchewan and across North America to know exactly the challenge Delta poses and how we must respond. All that is needed from our teachers, educational leaders and school divisions is the courage and leadership to follow the recommendations of our public health leaders to the letter.

But the fears and anxiety about the spread of COVID-19 continue to weigh heavily. That stress is compounded by the confusion born from inconsistent approaches to closing down and reopening our economy across the country. Many people still don't feel confident going out, and small businesses are suffering. Public health and government guidance may vary by region, but there is one indicator every Canadian can look for to know they are safe. The POST Promise logo in a storefront window is becoming a nationally recognized symbol of a businesses' commitment to doing their part to protect the health and safety of their customers and employees as COVID-19 restrictions ease. Participating businesses commit to following five steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These steps include maintaining physical distance, washing and sanitizing hands, keeping workplaces clean and disinfected, telling employees to stay home if unwell, and practicing respiratory etiquette, including wearing a mask when recommended. Businesses that make the POST Promise receive important information as to how they can help prevent the spread of COVID-19, and they have direct access to the latest and most up-to-date government and public health information. Across Canada, thousands of businesses are already participating, with more joining every day. The POST Promise is free and for the common good! The program has been designed to help consumers feel confident that the coffee shop, hardware store, or chiropractor's office is aware and doing what they can to help slow the spread. Businesses can only use and display the POST Promise logo after receiving the COVID-19 health and safety information, and committing to the five steps. The POST Promise is a private sector-led initiative, in collaboration with various levels of government, designed to help Canadians confidently and safely return to public spaces and the workplace. Organizations and associations representing more than 100,000 businesses across Canada have already endorsed the POST Promise. Our partners include the Business Council of Canada, Retail Council of Canada, Restaurants Canada, the Building Owners and Managers Association, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, and the Canadian Global Cities Council. Perhaps even more importantly, our members are mom-and-pop shops in small towns and big cities in every corner of this resilient country. By the time the first snow flies, you will find POST Promise signs on every Main Street in Canada, at your favourite diner, antique shop, and grocer. We want to thank the businesses across Canada that have made the POST Promise. You are leaders in keeping your customers and employees safe as our communities reopen. We welcome more businesses, of all sizes and industries, to make the POST Promise by going to postpromise.com . We all have a role to play in keeping our communities safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. Look for the sign, and if you don't see it, help spread the word. Let's stay healthy, support local businesses, and get our economy moving again, together. Laura Hearn is the President and Executive Director of POST Promise.

"Opinion: As far as politics goes, the COVID-19 pandemic changes everything. Or does it?",https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-as-far-as-politics-goes-the-covid-19-pandemic-changes-everything-or-does-it,nationalpost.com,Marie-Eve Desrosiers and Philippe Lagassé: It is not hard to see mistrust remerging as a potent political force,"['Marie-Eve Desrosiers', 'Philippe Lagassé', 'National Post']",2020-04-06 00:00:00,"By Marie-Eve Desrosiers and Philippe Lagasse Things will never be the same. This is a common refrain these days. Faced with the massive impact of COVID-19 on our lives, the economy, and our relationship with government, it is hard to think that our societies will go back to ""normal."" The pandemic will eventually pass. And when it does, there are reasons to hope that doubts about expertise and the role of government, as well as the conditions that breed economic inequality, might be alleviated. We are seeing scientists take centre stage and policy being crafted based on the best possible evidence at hand. Trust in government and political leaders is increasing in Canada and there's a growing sense of common cause, with well-paid professionals appreciating how much their lives depend on the poorly paid and precariously employed. Surely this will lead to a renewed embrace of expert advice, a positive role for government, and a commitment to reduce inequality when this is all over. But as pivotal as the moment seems, we should not forget that it comes at a time when trust in governments, expertise, and the economic system has been declining. Rather than changing everything, the COVID-19 pandemic might amplify this longer standing, less obvious crisis and the discords that have fuelled it. The respect shown toward public health officials and evidence-based policies at the moment is heartening. But it is not hard to see mistrust remerging as a potent political force. Questions about when travelling restrictions were imposed and based on what evidence are percolating. Debates about rates of infection in certain age groups or about whether asymptomatic people should be wearing masks are leading many to doubt what they are being told and to ask whether authorities are engaging in ""noble lying."" Many commentators have noticed that official policies were reversed in a matter of days and weeks, leading to doubts about the quality of the evidence that informed government positions. Many commentators have noticed that official policies were reversed in a matter of days and weeks The reality, of course, is that policy-makers always act based on imperfect information, particularly in rapidly evolving crises. Similarly, expertise is not omnipotence and there is an understandable hesitance to act contrary to what others in professional networks and international institutions are recommending. During a crisis, the need to show unity may even trump the careful consideration of alternative approaches. This is one way in which the battle against COVID-19 does resemble a war: those who are waging it are caught in a fog, working with the best information they have and the strategies they judge most appropriate, even if their approach ends up being faulty. Under the circumstances and the muddling through they require, no government will find itself above criticism. While solidarity and support are widespread today, they might give way to scrutiny and resentment, as citizens demand to know why states were not better prepared or hesitant to act sooner. But this could take a deeper form. The connection between populist politics and distrust in expertise and government is evident. Populist movements that have gained prominence across the world in the past decade have fed off the sense of disconnect people feel between their interests and values and those that are championed by governing elites and experts. Those who are already skeptical of technocratic government and officially sanctioned expertise could see their views reinforced as leaders do their best to work with the information and evidence they have available to them. Although many are applauding the return of ""big government"" and the central role of experts in responding to the crisis, in the long run responses to COVID-19 may feed populist fears. Populists may see this as another example of ""elites"" making decisions - and mistakes - far removed from everyday people and their right to make their own decisions. Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post Perhaps the social solidarity the pandemic is fostering will keep the scrutiny and resentment at bay. But we should remember that these are early days and that, as is quickly becoming apparent, not all are living the crisis in the same way. Long-standing divides may reappear once the full economic impact of the crisis, and the steps that are needed to pay for the emergency payments that were enacted, become evident. The disproportionate burdens and risks the pandemic will place on the least privileged is increasingly being recognized. Yesterday's job precarity has already translated into deep economic uncertainty for significant segments of the population under COVID-19. New government programs will help buffer economic hardships for now, but it will likely take years for many to recover what they have lost or will lose. As importantly, many will be dismayed if governments rush to re-establish the previous economic order. Those who already felt left behind before the pandemic risk feeling once again overlooked if government and business leaders strive to return to a status quo ante that rebuilds the economic structures many felt marginalized them or discredited their contribution to society. Photo by Sebastian Castaneda/Reuters Those who benefited from the world as it was, in turn, may feel they need to defend what they once had. Loss aversion may be powerful force in the coming years, and it could exacerbate the ideological split over income inequality, taxes, deficits/debt, and the overall role of the government in the economy and society. As noted, the fight against COVID-19 has been likened to a war. So far, Canadians appear to be ""rallying around the flag,"" doing what it takes to flatten the curve and support front-line workers and those who have lost their livelihoods. But it may be too optimistic to hope that the pandemic will ""change everything"" when it comes to attitudes about government and expertise, and the political factionalism that has marked Western democracies recently. From our admittedly pessimistic perspective, the pandemic may worsen the deeper crisis our political and economic institutions were already facing.

Opinion: Canada seems to have an 'open house' sign at all our major airports despite pandemic,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/comment-canada-seems-to-have-an-open-house-sign-at-all-our-major-airports,nationalpost.com,It’s easier for a grandparent in India to be reunited with their family in Canada than it is for a grandparent in Ontario to be reunited with their family in…,"['Rupa Subramanya', 'Special To National Post']",2020-12-22 00:00:00,"It's easier for a grandparent in India to be reunited with their family in Canada than it is for a grandparent in Ontario to be reunited with their family in Quebec Photo by Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press/File By Rupa Subramanya Is Canada doing enough at its international borders to protect the country from potentially COVID-19 positive travellers spreading the virus after they arrive? Premier Doug Ford of Ontario certainly doesn't think so. At a freewheeling news conference Monday, Ford lashed out at the federal government for its poor management of people arriving at Canada's major airports, especially Toronto's Pearson. He suggested that arriving passengers were not sufficiently screened and that many, he claimed up to 25 per cent, were not observing the 14-day mandatory quarantine. One feature of Canada's response to COVID-19 that is puzzling is the lax approach at the country's international airports. This stands in stark contrast with the Canada-U.S. land border, which has essentially been sealed since March for all but the most essential of purposes. When I returned from India in the spring, the lax approach at Pearson was evident. Even at that early stage of the crisis, many countries had restricted travel from hot spots such as China, and were rigorously screening and contact tracing those who had arrived. Meanwhile, arriving in Toronto, passengers were asked perfunctory screening questions and the follow-up was non-existent in many cases. Based on conversations I have had recently with some passengers who have returned from overseas, this situation has not changed much. Such laxity at this stage of the crisis is an indictment of the federal government's apparent lack of seriousness in protecting Canada's borders. It is not just the poor quality of control at the border, there is also no real control on who is allowed entry. In theory, Canada has strict rules that permit only citizens and permanent residents the right to return. In practice, holders of work permits, student visas, as well as the extended families of Canadian residents have been allowed to enter on compassionate grounds. Contrast this approach with Germany, where, apart from citizens and permanent residents of the European Union (EU), there is a strict and rigorously specified list of who may enter, such as scientists and researchers whose services are indispensable and who cannot perform their jobs from abroad. Is Canada being compassionate or has it become a chump? After cases in Canada spiked in the fall, the EU took Canada off its safe list of countries whose citizens are allowed to enter, but Canada took no such reciprocal action even though cases in Europe were also going up. The upshot is that it is easier for a German to visit Canada than it is for a Canadian to visit Germany. More On This Topic Bill Blair refutes Ontario's border security criticism, touts Canada's 'strong' COVID-19 restrictions Ford rips Trudeau government for failing to secure border as Ontario imposes strict new lockdowns It is not just advanced G7 countries such as Germany that are doing much better than Canada at the borders. Even a developing country such as India has much more rigorous control on who is allowed to enter. Passengers who have proof of a negative COVID-19 test no earlier than 72 hours are exempt from quarantine. Passengers who don't have a negative test have the option of a test on arrival at India's major airports, and if they're negative, they're exempt from quarantine. But, in the absence of either of these, passengers are subject to a mandatory seven-day ""institutional quarantine"" in a government-approved facility where compliance can be monitored and an additional seven days of home quarantine ordered. Likewise, Germany has had COVID-19 testing on arrival at its airports in place at least since July while Canada has only rolled out pilot testing in Toronto and Calgary about six weeks ago. Meanwhile, Canada seems to have an ""open house"" sign at all of the major airports, by continuing to allow passengers to enter even from known hot spots, including India and some European countries, without any testing and with quarantine and contact tracing whose enforcement is a joke at best. Ironically, it's easier for a grandparent in India to be reunited with their family in Canada than it is for a grandparent in Ontario to be reunited with their family in Quebec. In response to Ford's biting criticism, Canada's Health Minister, Patty Hajdu, has claimed that only 1.3 per cent of COVID-19 cases in Ontario are linked to passengers arriving from abroad. One could argue that this statistic is an underestimate, given how sophisticated the contact tracing would need to be, not just on international but on all connecting domestic flights and ground transport, to accurately capture anyone infected either directly or indirectly from someone arriving from abroad. Be that as it may, given the scale of the pandemic, if simple and proven measures such as widespread testing on arrival and controlling who is allowed to enter to reduce the risk of new infections originating from abroad could eliminate 1.3 per cent of new cases, why is the federal government failing to protect Canadians by neglecting to implement such basic measures?

"Aug. 16: Opinions vary on Hamilton’s urban boundary debate, vaccine passports and border reopening in today’s letters",https://www.thespec.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editors/2021/08/16/aug-16-opinions-vary-on-hamiltons-urban-boundary-debate-vaccine-passports-and-border-reopening-in-todays-letters.html,www.thespec.com,Dave Mechar writes that he already has proof of being fully vaccinated. Andrea McDowell says we need vaccine passports.,[],2021-08-16 00:00:00,"Planners won't get us out of this mess More expansionary planning leads to more inefficient communities. As we know planners have created the most inefficient communities in human history over the last 60 years. Planners are not likely to get us out of this trend. People are now recognizing this reality and are speaking up. This is a message to our leaders to please consider other models for developing and creating sustainable communities. Of course this would include overhauling the current planning organization and bringing in people who understand how to create sustainable communities. It cannot be based solely upon an artificial human creation called the economy and otherwise known as economic development. The people that can create this change for the most part do not come out of modern professional planning schools. It will be organic in nature and require a deep understanding and experience of the urban landscape. Walter Furlan, Hamilton Expansion cannot boost emissions I am writing to raise my concerns about the framework being used to decide if Hamilton's urban boundaries should be expanded. Hamilton Councillors unanimously declared a climate emergency in March of 2019. To the best of my knowledge, this climate emergency has not lessened in the intervening years. In fact, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate urges immediate action to reduce greenhouse emissions to avoid climate disaster. Given this, I fail to see how any rational decision can be made without determining which option - to expand or not to expand boundaries - will result in the least damage to the environment and then choosing that one. Councillors must undertake a meticulous emissions evaluation of each of the options and do their part to help avert or at least mitigate the climate crisis facing us all. Joanne Lewis, Hamilton Only determined action will do Over two years ago, on June 17, 2019, the Trudeau government declared a national climate emergency. At that time scientists reported that Canada was warming at twice the global average. That figure has likely grown. Since then the government has done little or nothing to reduce emissions locally or reduce exports of fossil fuels which, when burned, may result in even more greenhouse gas emissions annually than the already very high emissions that we report from activities on Canadian soil. Canada must stop listening to the currently very powerful oil and gas lobby. Plans for any new projects must be halted immediately and those currently extracting oil and gas must be wound down. Fossil fuel workers deserve a just transition to well-paid clean energy jobs and they are increasingly demanding one. They understand. Ending fossil fuel subsidies and other supports now, will release almost $18 billion annually. This will be a good start. I am beyond frustrated with the Trudeau government's inaction. Words alone cannot fix this. Only determined action at a governmental level. Eileen Shannon, Dundas Who needs vaccine passports? When I had my second vaccination I also received a small certificate from the Ministry of Health stating the date and type of vaccine I had. This folds up quite small and I keep it with my health card in my wallet. Other than the fact that Trudeau loves wasting taxpayers money why is there all this talk about vaccine passports? I like millions of others already have proof of being fully vaccinated. Dave Mechar, Waterdown Once again, Ford knows best Here we go again. Almost all top health leaders, plus the business community, agrees we need vaccine passports, but Doug Ford insists he knows better. Once again, deciding the wrong things for reasons of self interest. That is not leadership. Andrea McDowell, Burlington Not a split society, just a safe one Ontario needs a vaccination passport. It will give people peace of mind when visiting restaurants, concerts, sporting events and any places where a number of people gather. By doing this you will not create two societies as Doug Ford has suggested. What it will do though, is give people who enjoy those events listed (and more) a sense of safety. The easiest way to do the passport is with a special sticker placed on your OHIP card. Everyone in Ontario has a card- whether you are two 102. these stickers can either be mailed out or picked up at the local Service Ontario office. Gord Miranda, Hamilton Open border will save tourism To everyone whining about the border being opened to vaccinated Americans: The feds did this to save the tourism and hospitality sector, literally, save our lives. Try thinking of someone besides yourselves sometime. Alecia Marsalis, Hamilton Border reopening should work the other way As we seem to be getting some grip on COVID and at the same time it's starting to ramp up dramatically south of our border, can someone explain to me why have we opened our borders to Americans but they have not opened them to us (not that I want to go there)? Is it just me who feels it should be the other way around. Our leaders at work, inspiring. Tony Fallucco, Hamilton Read more about:"
"Opinion: Vaccines going well, but they alone won't save Saskatchewan",https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-vaccines-going-well-but-we-need-to-do-more-to-stop-covid-19-spread-in-saskatchewan,leaderpost.com,"""A third wave will prolong the pandemic and all its negative consequences: More deaths, more suffering ... and more economic impacts.""","['Nazeem Muhajarine', 'Cory Neudorf', 'Kyle Anderson']",2021-03-19 00:00:00,"Opinion: Vaccines going well, but we need to do more to stop COVID-19 spread in Saskatchewan Opinion: Vaccines going well, but we need to do more to stop COVID-19 spread in Saskatchewan Photo by Jack Boland / Toronto Sun / Postmedia Network To some of you, it may appear as if the COVID-19 pandemic is nearly over. To many others, that we are entering a catastrophic variants-driven third wave. Right now, either of these fates are possible. It is through the leadership provided by the government and our collective choices in the next few weeks that we will determine the path taken. Relaxing restrictions on private gatherings and congregated worship just as the COVID variants of concern (VOCs) are exponentially spreading in Regina is the exact opposite of what our government should be doing . And to focus on how many people will be vaccinated in the coming months is like telling someone not to worry about the wildfire racing toward their home because firefighters will be there by next week. Opinion: Vaccines going well, but we need to do more to stop COVID-19 spread in Saskatchewan Yes, vaccinations are going well and the news that Phase 2 is beginning ahead of schedule is a spark of hope . But we cannot rely on vaccination alone to save us. People do not develop immunity to the virus until two to three weeks after they are vaccinated, and it will still be months before most of our population is protected individually to protect us all, collectively. That gives the super-spreading variants plenty of time to create a third wave. Not only are the VOCs more easily spread, but epidemiological evidence informs us that B.1.1.7 is more transmissible and deadly than the original strain . This variant has quickly become dominant in Regina and it will soon be dominant throughout the province. As B.1.1.7 takes over, the number of cases will rise and so would hospitalizations and deaths. High immunization rates in our seniors should help decrease the worst outcomes in this age group, but it is a mistake to think that middle-aged and younger adults have nothing to worry about. Severe illness and death have happened in all age groups, especially with B.1.1.7. What's more, about one in 10 people who have had COVID is still unwell three months later, and doctors know little about how to help these individuals. The good news is that the spread of VOCs can be slowed by the same public health measures that have worked throughout the pandemic. The bad news is that because VOCs are more easily transmitted, stopping them requires that these measures be implemented and enforced more stringently - and very quickly - while there is still time. Saskatchewan has consistently implemented the least-strict protective measures in Canada. This has no chance of working against the variants. Our current measures are giving the VOCs a chance to reverse the gains we have made in recent months. We need to take a tougher approach to buy the time required for vaccines to kick in. We know no one wants to hear this. We wish that mere optimism would guarantee our success. The way to guarantee success isn't through wishes, but through a concerted effort to beat this virus. From provincial leadership, all the way down to each interaction between two people, every action counts. As scientists, we can only share our best understanding of what is happening, based on our training and analysis of current research, but it is up to all of us to implement these strategies of success. We must do all we can to reduce the spread of VOCs, until everyone has had the chance to be vaccinated. Many people in Saskatchewan have reduced their contact with others above and beyond what the government has deemed safe, to protect themselves and others. We applaud these efforts and urge everyone to adhere to the following guidelines: Avoid travel outside of your city or town for now; Avoid close contact with anyone outside your household; Minimize in-person shopping and choose take-out or delivery over restaurant dining. Stay out of bars. Work from home, or allow your employees to work from home, and attend virtual worship services only; Parents of school-age children who are attending classes, consider switching to online learning When you are around others outside your household, wear a high-quality, tight-fitting mask; Enjoy outdoor activities and visits safely by keeping your distance from others and consider wearing a mask if others may be nearby. We did this a year ago, and we can do it again, one last time. As important as individual actions are, we need our provincial government to do its part, too. Since last summer, our premier has consistently resisted putting in place the measures that have been shown to reduce viral spread. In Canada, Saskatchewan has had the highest per capita case-rate for over 60 days straight in 2021. The high rate of cases in our province compared to all other parts of the country shows that more aggressive approach is needed. Now, relaxing restrictions, combined with little enforcement to ensure public health orders are followed, has opened the door for VOCs to run rampant. A third wave will prolong the pandemic and all its negative consequences: More deaths, more suffering including mental health and long-term effects, and more economic impacts. It doesn't have to be this way. Continue the vaccine rollout and do what has been shown to work: Introduce stricter measures now to rein in a VOC-driven third wave of the pandemic in Saskatchewan.

"Opinion: Kenney should blame his inaction for COVID surge, not South Asian community",https://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-kenney-should-blame-his-inaction-for-covid-surge-not-south-asian-community,edmontonjournal.com,"As COVID-19 cases soar in Alberta, with the province now accounting for nearly 25 per cent of all active cases in Canada, Premier Jason Kenney appeared on a…",['Sharan Aulakh'],2020-11-08 00:00:00,"Photo by Chris Schwarz / Government of Alberta As COVID-19 cases soar in Alberta, with the province now accounting for nearly 25 per cent of all active cases in Canada, Premier Jason Kenney appeared on a popular South Asian radio station in Calgary, calling for the South Asian community to do more to bring down surging infection rates. According to Kenney, the South Asian community is responsible for the rapid rise in COVID-19 cases in Alberta, zeroing in on northeast Calgary, an area with a significant South Asian population, for having a particularly high number of COVID-19 cases. While Kenney tried to assure listeners that he doesn't mean to blame or target any particular individual or community, his message misses the mark. While the community is diverse, a large proportion of Albertans of South Asian descent are employed in essential frontline services and do not have the privilege of being able to work from home. They are grocery-store workers, transit operators, and truck drivers; they are the nurses, health-care aides, and support staff in clinics, hospitals, and long-term care homes. Along with an increased risk of exposure to COVID-19, many have limited employment benefits and access to compensated sick leave. South Asians are also more likely to live in multigenerational housing. Often, this is a result of financial constraints that are more likely to be faced by recent immigrants. Many within the South Asian community are on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic response. For the premier to selectively call out and chastise the South Asian community for seemingly shirking their responsibility in this pandemic betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the different structural factors that shape how COVID-19 disproportionately impacts certain communities. It further perpetuates unfair and harmful narratives of the community. In reality, the reason for the rise in COVID-19 rates in Alberta over the past month has been the Kenney government's relative inaction in the face of a worsening pandemic. Kenney's refusal to implement appropriate public health restrictions is the reason for the rapid spread of the virus, not South Asian culture. Alberta is currently the only jurisdiction in Canada that has not introduced a provincewide mask mandate. Even in the face of a broken contact tracing system, Kenney refuses to adopt the federal contact tracing app, citing the monstrous challenge of deleting the provincial app and downloading a different one. When Alberta physicians called for a two-week ""circuit breaker"" lockdown to limit the strain of the virus on the health-care system, Kenney responded with the closure of group yoga and spin classes. Over the weekend, hundreds of maskless Albertans took to the streets to participate in anti-mask demonstrations in Edmonton, Calgary, and Red Deer. Even though current provincial regulations limit outdoor gatherings to 10 people, Calgary police officers watched from a distance. While Kenney delivered a reprimanding ""wake-up call"" to South Asians, threatening the community with policing and monetary fines, he refused to condemn these anti-mask rallies. It is clear that for Kenney, the right to protest trumps Albertans' right to safety and health. Rather than scapegoat a community that has done much to combat the COVID-19 pandemic - from staffing hospitals to cleaning schools to driving buses - the provincial government would far better serve Albertans by prioritizing a pandemic response based on public health, not on ideology. While efforts to combat the virus are our collective responsibility, it starts at the top.

OPINION: Northwest can't be forgotten about in vaccine rollout,https://www.thegraphicleader.com/opinion/editorials/opinion-northwest-cant-be-forgotten-about-in-vaccine-rollout,www.thegraphicleader.com,"The light, albeit small, can now be seen at the end of this COVID-19 tunnel with the arrival of vaccines in Canada this week.",['Ryan Stelter'],2020-12-12 00:00:00,"Ontario was the first province to administer the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to a Toronto-based personal support worker Anita Quidangen. This week, 14 sites across the 10 provinces will be receiving Canada's first 30,000 doses. None of those sites are in northwestern Ontario. Does that surprise anyone? It doesn't surprise me. We are used to being forgotten about, our big province sometimes feels like nothing exists outside the Greater Toronto Area. The Northwestern Health Unit's top doctor, Dr. Kit Young Hoon, said she was not concerned that the northwest would be lost in the fray of the vaccine rollout. That is encouraging to hear but being the cynic I am, I feel as if that may not end up being the case. Northwestern Ontario is home to many remote communities that do not have regular, easy access to health care. Those communities, which could even include Kenora, should be a priority moving forward. I understand that this vaccine rollout will take time and we won't be back to normal life for quite some time, but the northwest can't be left behind. Our case numbers are staying low despite high numbers in Manitoba and southern Ontario, but that shouldn't mean we should be late to get the vaccine. The province says by the end of January 2021 over 20 hospitals across Ontario will be administering the Pfizer vaccine. Will one of them be Lake of the Woods District Hospital? Who knows. It's most likely too early to start predicting how things will play out."
Opinion: They're no Tom Brady: Our leaders keep dropping the ball in the battle against COVID,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-theyre-no-tom-brady-our-leaders-keep-dropping-the-ball-on-fighting-covid,nationalpost.com,"Like losing teams, our federal government continues to break our hearts mismanaging this pandemic","['Harry Rakowski', 'National Post']",2021-02-10 00:00:00,"Photo by Errol McGihon/Postmedia News By Dr. Harry Rakowski Why is it that some teams are perennial winners and others never seem to win, especially when the stakes are high? Like losing teams, our government continues to break our hearts mismanaging this pandemic. Tom Brady, remarkably at age 43, playing for a new team, just won his 7th Super Bowl when most people thought he was past his prime. He is the G.O.A.T - the greatest quarterback of all time. He almost wasn't drafted by the NFL. He was a slow runner, immobile, with a relatively weak arm. So why has he been so successful? He had incredible drive, fitness, self confidence and the ability to understand the game. It was about his determination to succeed, his leadership and execution. He was a winner and knew it, and so did everyone else. In Ottawa we have another goat, only this time the term is pejorative and implies letting your team down by making the bad play that causes your team to lose at a critical time - the intercepted pass, the fumbled football, the missed kick that turns victory into defeat. The importance of timely vaccine supply Canada has secured the largest number of vaccine doses per person in the world, so why are we so far behind in vaccinations? Ontario will get only a fraction of the promised Pfizer and Moderna vaccine supply in February with no clear delivery schedule in sight. We can't even determine how many doses we actually are promised. The Pfizer vaccine was initially authorized for five doses per vial; now it's been decided that it's six doses per vial. Except that special syringes are needed to squeeze that sixth dose out of the vial, and we don't have enough yet. Why doesn't our government fight for us? Trudeau simply says we are on target. What a mess! Winners, after getting punched in the mouth, get up off the floor and pick up their game. Why can't we produce our own vaccines? The expensive Montreal facility still under construction will not likely produce much vaccine in 2021. The prime minister had promised the startup of domestic vaccine production in July. But a day later we were told that significant production is unlikely until the very end of the year, or into 2022. The facility won't be able to make the most effective Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines. Vancouver's Precision NanoSystems offered to build an mRNA-capable facility last year, but only now has the government decided to invest $25.1 million in the project. Too little, too late yet again. In the meantime, we're being shamed internationally for choosing to be the only G7 country taking vaccines primarily set aside for poorer nations through COVAX. More On This Topic John Robson: Smug Liberal government is too incompetent to get vaccination right Tasha Kheiriddin: Canadians deserve a COVID election, because this crisis isn't going away soon What do we need beyond vaccination? New virus variants from the U.K., South Africa and Brazil are starting to dominate and threaten the efficacy of vaccines and antibody therapy. Today we continue to inadequately plan for the potential dangers ahead. What will we likely need? Are we content to suffer another losing season? Testing and tracking We continue to lag behind other countries in per capita testing and have an ineffective, underused tracking system. We need mandatory anonymized cellphone tracking and greater testing. Newer, more accurate antigen-based tests for infection are available and will be essential for travel and better workplace protection, especially as more contagious strains dominate. Why does the private sector have to lead the way in implementation? Data, data, data We need more accurate data on how and where outbreaks occur to have more precise targeted prevention. We need a national database on who was vaccinated when, with what vaccine, and centralized benefit and complication data. This will be even more critical as we will likely need enhanced booster vaccination to better protect against new virus variants in the fall and winter. Canada signed a contract for an IT platform only recently, when this should have been planned and implemented at least six months ago. Again it is late, poor planning. Different vaccines have different rates of protection, especially for the newer variants. We have no announced plans for antibody testing to determine vaccine efficacy even in our high-risk population. Protection We need better barrier protection with three-ply and N95 masks to meet evolving needs as new variants dominate and most of the population remains as yet unvaccinated. We also need domestic production of essential medicines. Our economy We need leaders who are there for the whole country, who don't ignore the needs of Western Canada. We need leaders who bring intelligent and nimble solutions to restart and grow our economic base. We need leaders who can march our team down the field in the fourth quarter and dare to win and refuse to blandly accept failure. Our future Canada has the opportunity to be the greatest country in the world. We have incredible resources, an intelligent and sensible population, world-class universities and institutions and unlimited space. What we lack is the leadership to excel. We are led by politicians whose primary focus is on winning elections. They lack vision, inspiration, critical thinking and planning. Unless we change we will never live up to our potential, let alone make it to the Super Bowl. Dr. Harry Rakowski is an academic Toronto cardiologist.

"Opinion: Health vs. economy debate will come, but it's a false choice",https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-health-vs-economy-debate-will-come-but-its-a-false-choice,calgaryherald.com,"It has not happened yet, but it is inevitable that we will have a public debate in Canada about whether, in the words of U.S. President Donald Trump, the…",['Duane Bratt'],2020-04-07 00:00:00,"Photo by SEAN KILPATRICK / The Canadian Press It has not happened yet, but it is inevitable that we will have a public debate in Canada about whether, in the words of U.S. President Donald Trump, the restrictions that have been imposed in response to the COVID-19 crisis is a case of ""the cure being worse than the disease."" Thankfully, no major Canadian political figure has made such a claim. However, there are certain pro-business and right-wing voices that have started to make this very case. See, for example, a recent column by Conrad Black or the twitter feed of Brett Wilson. In contrast, despite the restrictions that are already in place, there are some public health professionals and scientists, who argue that existing restrictions might have to last 18 or 24 months and some are demanding even more restrictions. This debate is currently at the margins, but there will be a time - maybe in a couple of weeks; maybe in a couple of months - when the debate goes into the mainstream. Of course, framing the debate as health care versus the economy is a false choice. Ending restrictions on businesses and public gatherings will not automatically restart the economy. Not if billions of dollars more need to be dedicated to health care to deal with the hundreds of thousands of cases and the tens of thousands of deaths (or more). Likewise, how will businesses function with a workforce and customers depleted due to COVID-19? Or people scared to go to work or shop because of the threat of COVID-19. Likewise, there is plenty of economic activity that needs to occur despite the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic. People still need to eat, so we cannot shut down the agriculture sector and grocery stores. People still need electricity and home heating, so we cannot shut down the energy sector. Nevertheless, when the rate of increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths starts to slow down or even reverse, there will be calls for restrictions to be lifted. The danger is that we may have just survived the first wave, and the possibility of a second wave intensifies if we move too quickly to reopen society. Conversely, we cannot indefinitely place harsh restrictions on society. At a certain point, some, if not all, are going to need to be lifted. Regardless of when this debate occurs in a serious way, there are a number of key political science concepts that are going to come into play: authority and legitimacy. Authority is a form of power in which people obey commands not because they have been rationally or emotionally persuaded, or because they fear the consequences of disobedience, but simply because they respect the source of the command. The one who issues the command is accepted as having a right to do so, and those who receive the command accept that they have an obligation to obey. Authority is focused in the one who commands, but legitimacy is the feeling of respect for authority that exists in those who obey - it is what makes authority possible. In other words, people have to trust the source of the command. This is especially critical in times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. A major challenge in how the United States is responding to COVID-19 is that many Americans do not trust the leadership of President Trump. His flip-flopping on policies and his narcissism has prevented Trump from taking the leadership role that naturally occurs in crises. The situation is very different in Canada. Even people who strongly oppose Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or Premier Jason Kenney have accepted their decisions. However, this could start to shift if people cease respecting authority. This could be because they do not trust the information provided, do not accept the rationale for severe restrictions, or believe that the decisions issued by authorities are harming them. Canada has enacted the most draconian restrictions in living memory. The Second World War may have led to the rationing of food, gasoline and other materials, but there were no social distancing requirements. Yet Canadians have largely obeyed these restrictions, because they believe that the orders are coming from a legitimate authority and accept their rationale of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Canadian state simply lacks the coercive power to enforce these restrictions in the absence of voluntary compliance. If you want to see what happens when society does not voluntarily comply with laws, just look at underage smoking and drinking, and, until its recent legalization, cannabis use. For those who argued that Canada should have acted quicker and closed our borders (stranding Canadians outside of the country) or shutting down schools and restaurants back in January or February, you need to consider whether society would have voluntarily complied at that time. When the inevitable debate about reopening the economy occurs, a major factor will be whether the existing restrictions can be sustained in the absence of voluntary compliance.

Opinion: Will life soon return to normal?,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-will-life-soon-return-to-normal,nationalpost.com,There is much to be hopeful for in the months ahead,"['Alon Vaisman', 'Sumon Chakrabarti', 'Zain Chagla', 'Special To National Post']",2021-03-22 00:00:00,"Photo by Carlos Osorio/Reuters files We have arrived at the one-year anniversary of the first pandemic-related restrictions in Canada. If you had asked most health professionals at that time to predict the status of the pandemic one year later, it's doubtful that any could have envisioned such an optimistic outlook, given that we had no effective therapies and limited testing and tracing. But 12 months later, Canada has four approved, highly efficacious vaccines, the vast majority of individuals living in long-term care facilities have been vaccinated and global efforts are dramatically reducing the burden of COVID-19. With the view looking more hopeful than ever, what can we expect in the next few months? Will life return to normal? For the past year, we have been obsessively watching daily case counts as a guide to the trajectory of the pandemic. While this number was somewhat useful in the pre-vaccine era, as widespread vaccination continues, it will become progressively less informative. The more important metrics to follow are deaths and hospitalizations, both of which will represent a declining proportion of cases as a whole. It is better to base policy decisions (such as the lifting of restrictions) on the number of hospitalizations and hospital capacity, rather than just the raw daily case counts. As COVID numbers decrease, the resources invested in mass testing and contact tracing will be able to be redirected to more focused efforts, such as targeted vaccinations, workplace safety and outbreak management. In fact, there will be a time in the not-so-distant future when the publishing of daily case counts will be stopped for good. As the science around vaccines progresses and we get more real-world data about how well they are working, our understanding of the characteristics of each vaccine will evolve, giving public-health experts insight into the optimal timing for second doses and the need for boosters. As with flu vaccination, different vaccines or different vaccination strategies may have to be considered for the young, elderly and immunocompromised. New focus will be placed on infants and the safest timing in this age group - with the aim of not only protecting children, but also preventing transmission to other vulnerable people in the community. Given the endemicity of COVID-19, this will likely be integrated into our standard childhood vaccinations. One of most significant anticipated changes is the lifting of restrictions on mingling with people outside our households. This move has already been made by the Centres for Disease Control in the United States, which recently announced that individuals who have been vaccinated may congregate with one another. Such recommendations are expected to come to Canada soon, likely slowly and in concert with falling case counts, hospitalizations and deaths. Perhaps as soon as this summer, we will be able to hug loved ones, spend time with each other indoors without masking and even eat indoors at our favourite restaurants. Canadians should also expect to be able to travel to several countries without the need to quarantine, once a significant proportion of our country has been vaccinated. Universal masking, however, may be here to stay, at least for a time, especially in health-care settings, to limit the spread of respiratory pathogens to vulnerable individuals. Although it would not be mandated, there may be ongoing use of masks in public by the general population as we saw in many Asian countries after the SARS outbreak. What are the changes that will remain in our everyday lives post-COVID? Firstly, the increased social acceptability around not working or going to school while ill, washing hands and generally being more attentive to hygiene for the benefit of others is likely to persist. Being self-sufficient in the manufacture of personal protective equipment, vaccines and other goods will leave us better prepared if another pandemic ever comes. Investments in health care and long-term care - including a focus on private rooms, stable staffing models, adequate ventilation, infection-control measures and adequate wages for care workers - will help better protect the elderly, whose vulnerability was laid bare during this pandemic. Finally, the pandemic resulted in widespread disruption in many sectors, including health care and education. A backlog of elective surgeries will need to be cleared, access to personalized mental health resources will need to resume and routine preventative medicine will need to be reinforced once again. Likewise, the immense gap left in children's learning and socialization will take many months or years to recover from. Many aspects of the economy, including small businesses, have also suffered a massive blow and the aftermath of this is another thing we may be reckoning with for many years to come. Despite all this, there is much to be hopeful for in the months ahead. Vaccines have continued to roll out in full force, and disease burden continues to lessen by the day. The light at the end of the tunnel is the brightest it has been for the entire pandemic. The future looks bright, and though challenges lie ahead, a return to normalcy is on the horizon and is finally within our reach.

Jan. 2021 MURAT YÜKSELIR / THE GLOBE AND MAIL, SOURCE: GOVERNMENT OF CANADA Nik Nanos is the chief data scientist at Nanos Research, a global fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, a research professor at the State University of New York in Buffalo and the official pollster for The Globe and Mail. Grappling with rising COVID-19 case counts, climbing death rates and anxious citizens, the pandemic has tested the resilience of governments around the world. The responses of nations have been diverse. China, because of strong central powers, has been able to respond swiftly and enforce public-health directives. Sweden's response, which had been more about recommendations for behaviour rather than quarantines and curfews, is largely influenced by its constitution and the fact it has no provision for declaring a state of emergency outside wartime. But the country just passed a new pandemic law giving it the same levers as many other countries. Then there is Canada. The postholiday period has seen a climb to more than 670,000 coronavirus cases and over 17,000 deaths, according the epidemiology update by the Government of Canada. A second wave is in full swing. Provinces are restricting businesses. Vaccines are being procured and the logistics to jab Canadians with doses are in motion. A look at the arc of public opinion suggests Canadians were generally satisfied with most of their governments in 2020, as federal and provincial leaders stayed focused on the scientific advice of public-health officials. Likewise, the open collaboration among premiers, and between them and the federal government, helped create an environment in which partisanship was seen to take a back seat. For many Canadians, a key point of comparison is the United States. In contrast to Canada, the messaging from the White House was influenced more by partisanship than by public-health concerns. President Donald Trump openly criticized Democratic governors and the U.S. political environment was characterized more by bickering than collaboration. Even with an imperfect pandemic response, things looked much better in Canada than they did south of the border. This fuelled an attitude of relative satisfaction. After a lull in the summer months, the proportion of Canadians who say COVID-19 is the top national issue of concern hit a second spike. Worry today, according to Nanos weekly tracking, is about as high as it was last March. Yet feelings of satisfaction remain high even as COVID-19 cases mount. The top emotions noted by Canadians include ""satisfaction"" (33 per cent), followed by ""optimism"" (18 per cent), ""pessimism"" (18 per cent), ""anger"" (15 per cent) and ""disinterest"" (8 per cent).

MURAT YÜKSELIR / THE GLOBE AND MAIL, SOURCE: NANOS RESEARCH A newly released 14-year tracking study on the federation by Nanos suggests that even though people may not be outright happy, they are giving increasingly positive assessments of the nation. After four years of declining scores on the relations between the federal and provincial governments, 2020 showed a significant jump. In 2019, a measly 12 per cent of respondents said relations had improved or somewhat improved. Fast forward to the 2020 evaluation and this increased to 40 per cent, the third-highest score in 14 years. Asked whether Canada is moving in the right or wrong direction, the proportion who said the country was moving in the right direction jumped from 41 per cent to 58 per cent over the past year - among the highest scores in more than a decade. Forty-seven per cent said the Trudeau Liberal government was doing a very good or somewhat good job (up from 27 per cent in 2019), while 31 per cent said the government was doing a very poor or somewhat poor job (down from 44 per cent in 2019). The positive evaluation was the second highest since tracking began in 2007. Scores on Canada's international reputation remain below average for the tracking study. Thirty-six per cent say our reputation has improved or somewhat improved (up from 22 per cent in 2019), 26 per cent say it has not improved or somewhat not improved (down from 43 per cent in 2019) while more than three in 10 (36 per cent) say the change is neutral. A masked woman walks past a mural in Vancouver this past November.Marissa Tiel/The Canadian Press The twist in the data is that, even with the COVID-19 infections and deaths, a second spike and our economy effectively on ice as many businesses cope with the pandemic, Canadians felt comparatively better in 2020 than 2019. The federation's pandemic response should be considered imperfect because we can never fight back the virus too quickly, help enough businesses survive or protect our at-risk populations enough. Imperfect is not bad, but it is an acknowledgement that we can do better as a nation. The upshot is that, even with the imperfections, Canadians felt better about the state of our federation in 2020 than in 2019. The imperfect response to the pandemic has also put a spotlight on the resilience of the federation - the ability of our politicians to set aside political gain for the public good, spurred by a common sense of purpose. Last year may be a political walk in the park compared with what lies ahead. The real stress test of the federation will occur over the next 12 months. First, the cost to fight the pandemic and keep Canadians economically above water will begin to mount. Although there is federal fiscal capacity, idling swaths of the economy such as the restaurant, hospitality and bricks-and-mortar retail sectors will not bode well for job prospects or the health of small and medium-sized enterprises. Second, the true unemployment rate and job disruption has been masked by government stimulus. In most recessions, unemployment is a lagging indicator. This means fallout of the labour market disruption that began last year may have a long tail rolling into late 2021 and 2022. Third, news of virus variants is a curveball for public-health officials and creates uncertainty in the battle against COVID-19. Finally, the promise and hope of vaccines to help transition to a new normal has buoyed optimism. One possible interpretation of current trends is that we are in a public opinion ""vaccine halo."" This will be the year of the vaccine and people can put the pandemic behind them. That is an optimistic view of the situation. A more pessimistic view is that the logistics of vaccinating Canadians will be complicated and perhaps it will take longer than anticipated to hit the herd immunity public-health officials are striving to reach. 2020 proved that even in the imperfect world, our federation remained resilient. The real test may be 2021 - whether we fight back the pandemic or become mired in a longer-term economic and public-health war of deadly attrition. Note on the data Nanos conducted an RDD dual frame (land- and cell-lines) hybrid telephone and online random survey of 1,048 Canadians, 18 years of age or older, between Dec. 27 and Dec. 30, 2020, as part of an omnibus survey.

With this plan, and as vaccine rollout continues across Canada, dreams of sandy beaches and days without deadlines don't seem as farfetched as they once did. Two weeks ago, I was pleased to join dozens of my association, council and chamber colleagues in sending a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asking the government of Canada to develop, in collaboration with the provinces, ""a clear and consistent pan-Canadian approach to reopening our communities, schools and businesses."" In order to realize dreams of sandy beaches and visiting friends and loved ones, the approach must include two things: a national framework for travel and a digital health pass. In the same way border authorities prohibit the transportation of plants and certain foods without permits due to the possibility of invasive species or disease, provinces and countries are looking to do the same as the pandemic wains, ensuring that anyone crossing their borders will not reintroduce a highly impactful virus or place undue burden on the local health system. This is ever more important when we consider variants that are still emerging, and an unclear picture on how long this virus may remain a problem for humanity. I, for one, think it will be longer than we'd like and may be endemic, much like the seasonal flu. The first part of the antidote to this situation is a national travel framework. What we have today is a patchwork of regulations within our country, as does the rest of the world toward us. Some places you can travel to freely, some not at all, others only if you are fully vaccinated. Federal leadership is needed to set a broad framework for how travel will work into, out of and within Canada, and then underneath that framework, provinces can address issues depending on their own situation. Alberta's Open for Summer Plan is demonstrating how vaccinations can be the best form of economic stimulus. When strong vaccine uptake is combined with sensible behaviours and public policy, they offer the promise of a needed boost to the economy through tourism and renewed support of small businesses, which will ultimately lead to increased prosperity for all Albertans. Like Alberta's reopening plan, our national framework should be forward-leaning, based on science and targets. Achieving that requires the second ingredient: digital health passes. Already being employed by the International Air Travel Association with its Travel Pass, many countries across the globe are looking to digital health passes that could be shown to border authorities reporting proof of testing or vaccination. For Canadians, this health pass must be an entirely voluntary undertaking. But if we want to see renewed travel, tourism, live experiences and the resumption of cross-border business, we must accept health passes as one tool to help safely speed our way to that future. The reality is this is happening whether we like it or not, with jurisdictions around the world, and in Canada, already giving differentiated access to vaccinated individuals. Israel, the United Kingdom, the European Union and the United States are all developing forms of certification that can be employed for travel assurances internationally. The only question is whether we'd like to play a lead role in developing or collaborating on a tool or have it imposed on us. Or worse still, be left out of the travel and tourism recovery. At a minimum, our approach should align with the U.S. Currently, many countries have a two-tier approach to international travel, with requirements for negative testing pre- and post-travel, 10-14-day quarantines on either end depending on the country, and intentionally punitive costs for travellers. Increasingly, many of these countries, like those in Europe, are waiving these requirements for the fully vaccinated. In Canada, Yukon is following suit, offering quarantine-free access to the vaccinated. There's a big incentive to do this from an economic standpoint too. Economist Tim Quinlan, suggests that 4.5 years' worth of spending on travel and services could take place in the coming months as restrictions relax, which in turn could help support Canada's economy if an effective travel framework and health passport system is put into place to capitalize on it. If we don't take advantage of this new opportunity, we may miss the literal boat. Understandably, some hesitancies exist around the concept of health passports that span legal, ethical and privacy-related concerns. Beyond this, special attention needs to be paid to racialized and marginalized communities, and individuals who, for medical reasons, cannot get vaccinated. Should those who cannot get vaccinated be unable to travel indefinitely as a result of their ailments? Can, and should, we endorse health exemptions within the travel framework? And most importantly, how do we effectively build trust and rapport with communities with low vaccination intentions due to historical harms? Rather than shying away from these complex questions, it is imperative that we embrace these concerns as areas of importance as Canada moves towards reopening our borders. And address them quickly and directly. Starting with inter-provincial travel, we must first look within, continuing to vaccinate our populations, easing restrictions to reintroduce much-needed group activities and reopening businesses to full capacity. The prize of getting this right is immense. If we can recover employment in our hardest-hit sectors like travel and tourism, Canada could potentially hit employment levels greater than those before the pandemic. For our public health and our economy, it's the right thing to do. Adam Legge is the president of the Business Council of Alberta.

Opinion: We should be able to put politics aside for the greater good,https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-we-should-be-able-to-put-politics-aside-for-the-greater-good,montrealgazette.com,"The effects of the labour shortage are real, but criticism of the Trudeau government’s CERB program is unfair.",['Martine St-Victor'],2021-09-03 00:00:00,"Photo by Pierre Obendrauf / Montreal Gazette In a conversation with a friend last week, I defended Republican George W. Bush. Me, the Democrat. I lived in the U.S. when Bush was elected president and I know how ravaging some of his policies have been. But when he took to the podium at a recent 9/11 20th anniversary commemoration and spoke about violent extremists - abroad and in the U.S. - I could only agree. ""There is little cultural overlap between violent extremists abroad and those at home,"" he said in reference to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, but ""they are children of the same foul spirit, and it is our duty to confront them."" In that moment, Bush became a warning voice of reason. We should be able to recognize when good is being done in politics, even if the coup doesn't come from the party we pledge allegiance to. You don't have to walk far in Montreal to see a Help Wanted sign, and another and another. The effects of the labour shortage are real: from reduced store hours, to restaurants without waiters, to manufacturers unable to fill customer orders. Trudeau is giving too much money away! We'll be paying for this extravagance for generations! Employers can't hire because workers are on CERB! I've been hearing these lamentations in my entourage, from other electors and from some members of the opposition. I find them and criticism of the Trudeau government's CERB program unfair. The Canada Emergency Response Benefit was put in place to offer financial support to Canadians directly affected by COVID-19. The monthly $2,000 payment was always meant to be a temporary measure. It has since been reduced to $1,200, gross, and certainly isn't the real culprit of the labour shortage. Already in 2018, a survey from the Business Development Bank of Canada showed that 40 per cent of Canadian SMEs - small-to-medium enterprises - had difficulty filling open positions. It's a situation the BDC says is here to stay, notably because of Canada's aging population. This week, a report in La Presse revealed that headhunters were swamped like rarely before , having to fill an increased number of mid- to superior-level positions - positions that pay more than the CERB ever did. And then there are cultural changes, amplified by the pandemic. More emphasis is being placed on workplace flexibility and the pursuit of happiness, not only at home but also at work. In addition, there are the variations on ""know your value,"" which have been supported by everything from books to TED talks and became drivers for workers asking for better wages and conditions. CERB or no CERB, things have changed and so has what employees want. Some who benefitted from the CERB were not intended recipients. There were flaws in the program and there was potential for abuse. But the same can be said about the Regie de l'assurance maladie du Quebec (RAMQ), particularly before photos were added on the cards to protect against counterfeit and fraud. Nonetheless, our universal access to health care is something we boast about and is the envy of many around the world. In Quebec and in Canada, we take care of each other. We're not perfect, as history books and recent headlines remind us. Still, this pandemic is proof the system we've invested in works, particularly in comparison with countries that didn't have a sliver of the safety nets many of us were able to rely on since the beginning of COVID-19. There are plenty of things to criticize the Trudeau government for, but the implementation of the CERB shouldn't be one of them. Such aid is a reflection of the benevolent country we live in. Surely we can recognize that, regardless of what party we'll vote for. Martine St-Victor is a communications strategist and media commentator based in Montreal.

Opinion: Small business recovery needs to be a top issue this election,https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-small-business-recovery-needs-to-be-a-top-issue-for-municipal-candidates,calgaryherald.com,"The federal election may be over, but don’t take your voter hat off just yet! That’s right: it’s municipal election time.",['Calgary Herald'],2021-10-17 00:00:00,"Opinion: Small business recovery needs to be a top issue for municipal candidates Opinion: Small business recovery needs to be a top issue for municipal candidates Brendan Miller/Postmedia Considering nearly 80 per cent of Alberta small businesses say issues related to their business have been largely ignored by their local governments, this upcoming municipal election is an opportunity for candidates to first change this perception and, second, have a vision that ensures small businesses can recover from the impacts of the pandemic and thrive in their local communities. Opinion: Small business recovery needs to be a top issue for municipal candidates There is no time like the present for municipal candidates to act given the worrying position our small businesses are in. Only 33 per cent are back to normal sales. Those that have taken on COVID-related debt owe an average of nearly $335,000, and around one in five businesses remain at risk of closing. Those alarm bells you're hearing? That's the alarm to municipal candidates. Small business economic recovery needs to be one of their top priorities. The good news is we have seen municipal governments across Alberta step up and act quickly to help small businesses. Expedited patio permitting, reduced property taxes and grant supports are some examples that have all been helpful moves. But as the most recent round of provincial restrictions has shown us, we're not out of the woods just yet. All of these measures need to continue and be made a focus in municipal elections to ensure economic recovery at the local level. In a recent survey, Alberta small business owners made it clear that their top priorities for municipal officials are to lower existing costs and commit to no new ones, especially as it relates to property taxes. Property taxes mark the highest municipal cost for local businesses. Nearly three-quarters of Alberta small business owners said lowering property taxes would help their business succeed. This makes sense given how low revenues have been during the pandemic. Remember: property taxes are profit insensitive. Businesses have to pay them whether or not they're bringing in any revenue. In addition, over two-thirds of Alberta small businesses have seen an increase in their property taxes over the last four years. This should concern all municipalities, especially when 80 per cent of small businesses have not fully recovered. It has also caused nearly two in five (37 per cent) of small business owners to consider relocating altogether. Again, this should cause urgency for all municipalities to address property taxes in the upcoming election. There are some municipalities that have worked hard to create a fair property tax system. According to CFIB's latest Alberta Municipal Watch Report, the municipality of Leduc, for example, has a near-perfect fairness ratio of 1:1 - meaning business owners pay a near equal portion of their property taxes to the proportion of commercial assessment values. Whereas the opposite is true in municipalities like Calgary, where businesses make up only 20 per cent of the property assessment share in the city, yet they are responsible for paying nearly half (46 per cent) of Calgary's property taxes. Calgary doesn't have to look far to find other municipalities within Alberta that have achieved property tax fairness. Now is the time for all municipalities to look inward at how they can create a fairer property tax system for business owners. The pandemic has reminded us how vital small businesses are to creating thriving, healthy communities. It is time for municipal candidates to pay attention to the issues and needs of small business owners. If we want a vibrant post-pandemic local economy full of cafes, local shopping, lunch and dinner dates, then it's time for municipal governments to consider the costs we are putting on small businesses now. Reducing commercial property taxes is the best place to start. But there are also other ways to help support local businesses, like continuing to reduce red tape, reduce spending, ensure small businesses are not negatively impacted by municipal construction projects, and encourage and promote local shopping. These measures all put together are equally important to help to ensure our local businesses can recover and thrive in our communities. Business owners can sign CFIB's own online petition - https://initiative.cfib-fcei.ca/alberta-municipal-elections/ - that asks all business owners what measures they would like to see addressed by their municipal candidates, such as, shop local campaigns, reducing red tape, addressing property taxes and creating a construction mitigation strategy.

Opinion: Five reasons why COVID shouldn’t spook us this Halloween,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-five-reasons-why-covid-shouldnt-spook-us-this-halloween,nationalpost.com,"Their costumes may be scary, but we shouldn’t be afraid of letting children celebrate Oct. 31, say four infectious disease specialists","['Drs. Jennifer Grant', 'Martha Fulford', 'Jocelyn Srigley', 'Neil Rau', 'Special To National Post']",2021-10-19 00:00:00,"Photo by Getty Images/iStock By Drs. Jennifer Grant, Martha Fulford, Jocelyn Srigley and Neil Rau How times change. A year ago, we had no COVID-19 vaccinations, Halloween was cancelled in many parts of the country, and we were entering a winter of fear. This October we should take stock of how far we have come heading into Halloween 2021: 1. Outdoor activities are OK From the beginning, even before vaccination, it has been obvious that interactions outdoors are very unlikely to transmit COVID . We almost never identify super-spreader events that have resulted from an outdoor event or gathering. This winter, go out and enjoy skiing, snowshoeing or a nice walk in the park - for your mental and physical health. 2. Population immunity has defanged the virus Vaccines reduce severe outcomes by 96 per cent and Canada has vaccinated almost 90 per cent of those who are eligible; 91 per cent of Canadians over 70 are fully vaccinated. If you are somebody with a normal immune system , and you are either vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19, your chances of getting sick enough to need the hospital are very, very small - no higher than other common respiratory virus such as the flu. The notable exception is those who have weakened immune systems. Providing more vaccine doses and using novel therapies may help those people fight off disease. If you are at risk and don't have immunity, there is still the opportunity to protect yourself by getting vaccinated. Even a single shot reduces your risk of getting very sick; two are even better. 3. The Delta variant shouldn't spook us any longer Delta is now causing most COVID-19 infections in Canada. Some people were concerned that the Delta variant would be more deadly, but it hasn't proven to be so since hospitalizations and deaths are lower and dropping in most places. Even in low-risk populations that aren't yet vaccinated, such as younger children, Delta variant is proving to be no more likely to result in hospitalization or death than previous variants. 4. For most kids, COVID-19 is the sniffles Parents worry about their children, but the preponderance of data provides reassurance . In Canada we have had almost 350 000 cases of COVID-19 cases in people under the age of 20 with only 0.5 per cent needing hospitalization. Of those, almost two-thirds were admitted for reasons other than COVID. In short, 99.9 per cent of kids who contract COVID-19 are fine. Even before vaccines were available, the risk of death by accident was seven times higher than from COVID (based on a mean from Statistics Canada of 128 accidental deaths per annum for one to 14 year olds). Data from schools around the world have also proven that transmission is rare in schools and even in areas of high community spread, Delta variant or not, the risk of hospitalization is low and deaths are very rare for children and teachers alike. Likewise, we need not fear ""long COVID."" Multiple well-performed studies put the risk of prolonged symptoms after COVID infection in children at between zero and one per cent, with resolution to normal within 12 weeks. 5. Much of the world is giving up restrictions, and we will have to follow While some places such as Saskatchewan, B.C. and Alberta have seen recent surges, we are seeing that places that were hardest hit at the beginning of the pandemic, like Ontario and Quebec, have been having much smaller fourth waves. There are many factors that may explain why some places are doing well and others aren't, including previous population exposure and vaccination rates. Places like the U.K., Denmark, Norway and many U.S. states have lifted restrictions, and disease rates have dropped or stabilized, not increased. Likewise, deaths have remained low in most places, especially those with high levels of immunity. COVID-19 is becoming a part of life where caution is needed by a few, but the rest of us need to move on. We need to learn from these experiences as we move to an endemic (""we need to live with it"") mindset. We do the same when we drive, play sports, or cross the street. This is especially true for children who need to catch up after 18 months of severe restrictions. This Halloween cherish the little goblins, fairies and witches; their costumes may be scary, but we shouldn't be afraid.

Opinion: COVID-19 and workers in the gig economy,https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/opinion-covid-19-and-workers-in-the-gig-economy/,montrealgazette.com,"Among other things, this pandemic is a wake-up call to update labour policies to better take into account the realities of many Canadians.",['Nura Jabagi'],2020-03-12 00:00:00,"Among other things, this pandemic is a wake-up call to update labour policies to better take into account the realities of many Canadians. Photo by PHILIPPE HUGUEN / AFP/Getty Images Trudeau announced two measures to help workers. The first is the waiving of the mandatory one-week waiting period on Employment Insurance (EI) claims to allow quarantined, and self-isolated, individuals to receive pay in the first week of their claim. The second is the extension of the work-sharing program to provide compensation to employers struggling to support employee incomes for up to 76 weeks. Unfortunately, many, if not most, gig workers do not have access to federal benefits, so reducing the wait time for EI claims is of no value to them. Similarly, Canada's Work-Sharing Program is ""designed to help employers and employees avoid layoffs when there is a temporary reduction in the normal level of business activity that is beyond the control of the employer."" Though COVID-19 is certainly beyond employers' control, the Work-Sharing Program is irrelevant to gig workers who are classified as independent contractors. Given the legal battles launched by gig-economy heavyweights like Uber to fight the designation of independent contractors as employees, gig organizations are unlikely to be interested in the Work-Sharing Program, considering the precedent this may set. In short, the government's plan leaves a significant portion of Canada's most vulnerable population in the lurch. Federal Labour Minister Filomena Tassi comment that she has "" not been overwhelmed with people that are saying, ‘We don't want to go to work and we feel compelled to go to work "" underscores the government's lack of understanding of many gig workers' situations. The vast majority of gig-economy platforms focus on low- to medium-skilled work, and gig workers on these platforms have little bargaining power as compared to workers performing high-skill work on platforms like UpWork. Many low-skilled gig workers put in more than 40 hours a week and/or are dependent on the platform as their sole income source, while others work more than one job. They can't take a day off work, let alone 14 days, should they fall ill. Though Uber and Lyft have announced that they will begin offering drivers up to 14 days of paid sick leave if they contract COVID-19, or are quarantined, it's unclear how these companies will assess claims and determine drivers' compensations. Given the unsustainable economics of the ride-hailing industry, whether (and to what extent) Uber and Lyft keep their promises remains to be seen. Nevertheless, the fact that Uber has offered sick leave is interesting insofar as the gesture suggests that drivers are indeed part of its core business ( something the company has long argued against ). The Canadian government should consider this pandemic a wake-up call. Labour policies must be updated for the gig economy and to protect vulnerable workers. Fortunately, the government may find that reinventing the wheel is unnecessary, specifically for low-skilled gig workers. Most gig-economy platforms that mediate low-skilled, on-demand services (e.g. Uber) are managed by algorithms. Although algorithmic management is necessary to ensure efficiency, algorithms exert high levels of control on workers with platforms designed to psychologically manipulate workers into working more hours. Such strategies reaffirm that gig workers are central to these companies' businesses and that they are in reality de facto employees who should be eligible for EI and other government benefits.

OPINION: Let's get through this vaccine rollout together,https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-lets-get-through-this-vaccine-rollout-together,torontosun.com,"When the pandemic was declared more than a year ago, Ontarians and public leaders rallied because we were ""in it together.""","['Rocco Rossi', 'James Scongack', 'Garrick Tiplady']",2021-05-07 00:00:00,"Photo by Supplied / Toronto Sun When the pandemic was declared more than a year ago, Ontarians and public leaders rallied because we were ""in it together."" However, in recent months it seems as though that enthusiasm and spirit of collaboration has waned. Now, as a stable and reliable increase in vaccine supply from the federal government has allowed the province to further expand booking eligibility for COVID-19 vaccination appointments, we must once again reignite our collective spirit of solidarity to usher in the next critical phase of the COVID-19 vaccination program. As soon as Ontario's population is vaccinated, we can move on to a safe and sustainable reopening of the province's economy. Closures buy us time at a high cost to business, our economy, as well as the mental and the long-term health of Ontarians. An expedited vaccine rollout prioritizing hot spots and essential workers who cannot work from home is critical to preventing these stops and starts that are so damaging for business. The next weeks and months are critical as more supply is being made available. As supply ramps up, we need an all-hands-on-deck approach to move these vaccines from freezers to arms as quickly as possible. There are so many businesses, universities, colleges, associations and labour unions raising their hands and bringing private sector resources to the table in support of vaccination efforts through the Ontario Chamber of Commerce's Ontario Vaccination Support Council (OVSC). From establishing a directory of voluntary resources to assisting public health units with efficiently rolling out vaccines in their jurisdiction, establishing mass vaccination facilities and clinics, and lending volunteers and resources to support ride programs, OVSC members have truly stepped up to make a difference. More On This Topic ICU nurses forced to wait four months for second jab: RNAO All pregnant women in Ontario now eligible for COVID vaccine Co-founding partners like Facebook Canada worked quickly to connect Canadians to credible sources of information from health experts like the Ontario Health Ministry through their COVID-19 Information Centre. Bruce Power provided logistical support and expertise to set up a ‘Hockey Hub' at the Point Edward Memorial Arena in Lambton County. There are also a number of successful examples of that collaboration. For example, the Cornwall Chamber of Commerce partnered with Ontario Power Generation and Choice Taxi to get residents to and from their COVID-19 vaccination appointments free of charge. Colleges like Seneca and Centennial, as well as the University of Guelph and Brock, have all partnered with their local health authorities to set up community vaccination clinics. As the COVID-19 vaccine rollout ramps up across Canada and Ontario, building trust and confidence in vaccines will be critical for the health of Canadians and the recovery of our economies. Connecting people and businesses with credible sources of information from health authorities is an essential part of this work, as is the cross-industry collaboration enabled through the OSVC. Led by Labatt, several Council members, celebrities and organizations have worked together to partner on vaccination hesitancy campaigns such as ThisIsOurShot.ca . More importantly, as supply increases, clarity of how and when people can sign up will be key. So too will be that spirit of collaboration among levels of government and with business, academia and labour. As we have said from the onset of this crisis, public health and the health of our economy are interdependent. Vaccine deployment and distribution are critical to reopening businesses safely, restoring consumer confidence, ensuring a robust economic recovery and saving lives. We see the light at the end of the tunnel. We are still in this together. Now, let's act like it and get the job done. - Rocco Rossi is President and CEO, Ontario Chamber of Commerce and OCSV Council Co-Chairs, James Scongack is Executive-Vice President of Corporate Affairs & Operational Services at Bruce Power and Garrick Tiplady is the Managing Director of Facebook Canada Your Midday Sun From our newsroom to your inbox at noon, the latest headlines, stories, opinion and photos from the Toronto Sun.

Opinion: We must counter long-term biological effects of COVID-19 stress on kids’ health and development,https://vancouversun.com/opinion/opinion-we-must-act-now-to-counter-long-term-biological-effects-of-covid-19-stress-on-kids-health-and-development,vancouversun.com,It's not too late to prevent children growing up in the pandemic from becoming casualties.,['Michael S. Kobor'],2020-07-11 00:00:00,"Opinion: We must act now to counter long-term biological effects of COVID-19 stress on kids' health and development Opinion: We must act now to counter long-term biological effects of COVID-19 stress on kids' health and development Institutions, educators and scientists can advocate for young people who do not have a voice in policy discussions Photo by Paola Giannoni / PNG One fortunate aspect of COVID-19 is that children have been less directly affected by the disease. But despite the relatively low incidence of severe illness in children, the response to the pandemic may have long-term adverse effects on the health and well-being of children and adolescents. As researchers in psychology, genetics and developmental biology in the Social Exposome Research Cluster at University of British Columbia and the Child and Brain Development Program of CIFAR (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research), we investigate the biological mechanisms by which social factors get ""under the skin"" to influence child health and development. We are concerned because some of the unintended consequences of the public health response to the pandemic are increased stressors for children and adolescents . Opinion: We must act now to counter long-term biological effects of COVID-19 stress on kids' health and development These stressors - reduced family income, food insecurity, parental stress and child abuse - can become biologically embedded and negatively impact children's developing brains, immune systems and ability to thrive . While some effects will be immediate, many will surface decades from now. For the more than 500,000 Canadian children under the age of 18 living in poverty (and one in four children in single-parent households) prior to the pandemic, the shocks have been great. As of June, the unemployment rate in Canada reached a record high of 13.7 per cent, with cumulative employment losses over three million since February. This is especially worrisome. One striking example shows that financial hardship in early life is related to higher risk of metabolic syndrome and physical health problems in adulthood, often independent of adult income and resources. The concern now is the extent to which these massive shocks will impact children's lifelong health and well-being. Children and adolescents are facing these stressors without access to the stabilizing routines and activities that typically support their development. For adolescents, who need peer interaction to support development, social deprivation and reduced opportunities for social learning are likely to have far-reaching consequences on their development and mental health . Biological pathways Stressors stemming from the pandemic may become biologically imprinted in children and leave a lasting mark on child and adult health and well-being. There are several biological pathways that can be modulated by early life experiences, but epigenetics - a process that turns genes ""on"" or ""off"" - is particularly well-studied. Epigenetic changes associated with early experiences can last into adulthood and may be linked to stress, inflammation and chronic heath conditions. While scientists continue to map the exact mechanisms by which early experiences impact adult health, what is clear is that children who experience adversity early in life are at heightened risk for later mental, social and physical health problems. Additional protections for children and families are needed to prevent the negative effects of COVID-19 from following children, especially those already at greatest risk, into adulthood. Creative and safe plans are required for reopening schools and allowing safe social interactions. These measures will benefit all young people, but a specific focus is needed to support young people most affected by the amplification of social inequalities. In particular, as we emerge from this crisis, more support is required for those who may have experienced child abuse and domestic violence. Helping children and adolescents thrive It's not too late to prevent children and adolescents growing up in the pandemic from becoming unintended casualties. We are facing the possibility of seismic shifts in population health and well-being if we do not act. The good news is that there are specific and evidence-based actions we can take. The presence of warm and supportive adults can protect children from stressful life events. Close bonds between parents and children are protective against the harmful, long-term effects of financial insecurity on the immune system - extending into adulthood. Grandparents, teachers, coaches, other important adults and close-knit communities in the lives of children are offering inspiring examples of how to creatively connect and support children digitally and in physically, but not socially, distanced ways. Creating opportunities for children and adolescents to be involved in the rebuilding plan can empower young people as leaders. A diverse youth advisory council, such as the Mental Health Commission of Canada's Youth Council, can advocate by incorporating the wisdom and vision of young people's lived experiences. We urge policy-makers to seek scientific evidence and consult with experts focused on child development, including pediatricians, psychologists and researchers in the biology of early life experiences. To start, policy-makers should invest in solutions to minimize the evidence-based Top 10 Threats outlined by Children First Canada. These include depression, anxiety and child abuse - all of which are amplified by the pandemic. Finally, we urge the creation of diverse federal and provincial pandemic recovery task forces to create an evidenced-based strategy for supporting children and adolescents. Institutions, educators and leading scientists also have a role to play in advocating for young people who do not vote, and as a result often do not have a voice in policy discussions. The late Dr. Clyde Hertzman, founding director of the Human Early Learning Partnership, was a tireless advocate for increasing investments in child health and education to prevent adversity in childhood from evolving into disease. His life motto of ""it doesn't have to be this way"" has never been more relevant. Now is the time to work quickly and collectively to ensure that this pandemic does not leave its imprint deep in the biology of the next generation. Michael S.

Opinion: There’s only one thing left to say to the unvaccinated,https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/opinion-theres-only-one-thing-left-to-say-to-the-unvaccinated,montrealgazette.com,"There are understandable reasons for some people to put off the jab. But the clock is nearing midnight, and our children are at risk.",['Jason M. Opal'],2021-07-07 00:00:00,"There are understandable reasons for some people to put off the jab. But the clock is nearing midnight, and our children are at risk. Photo by Allen McInnis / Montreal Gazette My family and I just visited the United States, spending precious time with loved ones whom we had only seen on screens since the COVID-19 ordeal began. Of the many memories from this trip, two stand out. First, there was the shocking disinterest of most people to the ongoing threat of the virus. We saw crowded bars, packed restaurants and almost boastful indifference. I recall in particular three young kids in a boozy lakeside bistro in half-vaccinated Wisconsin, where the hospitals are bracing for new surges. Second, there was a distant relative, a fiercely intelligent man who told me he hadn't wanted the vaccine but that he got his two jabs all the same. ""Sometimes,"" he explained with a sigh, ""you've got to take one for the team."" I breathed easier once we were north of the border again. In Montreal, as throughout Canada, a range of common-sense rules spreads a protective blanket over our eight- and 11-year-olds. But even here in the land of peace, order and good government, about six million eligible people haven't been vaccinated. Cases are spiking again in Quebec, where more than a quarter of 18- to 29-year-olds have yet to get a single shot. Meanwhile, the days are getting shorter, the shadows longer. Next week, the kids will be in school again - and judging by what's happening in the U.S. , that could mean large numbers of sick children and quite a few very sick ones. At this point, the only solution besides more masking is for every eligible person to get the jab. More vaccinations means fewer vectors, and fewer vectors means less virus in classrooms and cafeterias. Authorities have tried to cajole and convince the holdouts. They are now trying to bribe and browbeat, using the carrot of lotteries and the stick of passports. Still, the vaccination numbers are flat. This is hard for me to accept, but that's partly because I'm the son of an infectious-diseases specialist. I was eager to get the vaccine. Most people are more skeptical of medical expertise. Who hasn't run into a tone-deaf doctor or had to wait too long to see one? Plenty of people don't trust modern science, which has of course delivered its share of horrors. For some Montrealers, it's hard to get to a vaccination site or to make oneself understood there. Others simply don't like needles. All of these are understandable reasons to put off the jab. But the clock is nearing midnight. The nightmare approaches: the crowded wards, the rushed intubations, the frantic care for little bodies. Public authorities are out of options, especially after they shut society down last year to protect the elderly. They don't have the will or the means to do the same thing now for the young. So there's only one thing left to say to those who don't want to get the vaccine: We need you to do it anyway. In my troubled homeland to the south, the willingness to do something against your inclinations was once called virtue. It was the hope for a society cut loose from the restraints of monarchy. And virtue has had a remarkable career in the U.S., inspiring acts of selflessness that give the lie to cheap anti-Americanism. The old dream is clouded today, struggling for breath within a culture whose can-do individualism has decayed into give-me selfishness and outright lunacy. Hence, the unmasked crowds we dodged in Wisconsin. Yet it lives on in little acts of courage. It persists in my vaccine-hesitant relative, who knew that sometimes you have to take one for the team.

Opinion: It's time for Canadians to start travelling again,https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-its-time-for-canadians-to-start-travelling-again,financialpost.com,The government must salvage the summer season that is the lifeblood of so many Canadian workers and businesses,"['Don Cleary', 'Special To Financial Post']",2021-06-30 00:00:00,"Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post files The big question Canadians are asking themselves on the eve of the summer holiday season is whether it is OK to travel. For the last 16 months, the tourism industry has made adjustments to help ensure the safety and peace of mind of travellers. A successful Canadian vaccination campaign is firmly taking hold, and COVID-19 cases are dropping dramatically. The provinces are beginning to announce the lifting of restrictions. We finally seem to be turning the corner on a return to life as we know it - and that should include travel. Yet we are in danger of missing another critical summer season, given the government's lack of a clear plan to reopen borders and restart the tourism sector. Most tourism in Canada happens in summer, and a broad spectrum of tourism-related businesses are facing a dire situation. Many won't survive the loss of a second summer. The travel limitations the government implemented while COVID-19 was overwhelming Canada's health-care system were appropriate and largely successful. Now, before it's too late, the government should heed its own expert advisors and provide a timetable for a return to travel, based on advice from health officials, to salvage the summer season that is the lifeblood of so many Canadian workers and businesses. As public health and government officials have repeatedly told us, vaccinations are the most important element in getting back to normal life. After a slow start because of vaccine supply challenges, Canada is quickly becoming one of the most vaccinated countries in the world. Marriott International has joined Faster, Together, a coalition of labour, business and individuals encouraging Canadians to get vaccinated. We also introduced our Vaccination Care Program, which provides education, schedule flexibility, and a financial award at our managed hotels for employees who get vaccinated. The recent announcement lifting some quarantine restrictions for fully vaccinated Canadians and permanent residents offers some optimism. But it is a small first step and fails to give Canadians something to look forward to as the vaccination effort continues. In other G7 countries, guidance has been updated to allow for the resumption of most activities. Not everyone is ready to travel tomorrow, and it is important that we continue to follow public health advice. But Canadians should be given the opportunity to travel, without shame or anxiety, and within the confines of the safety protocols that have already proven successful. And fully vaccinated international travellers should once again be able to travel to Canada and enjoy the extraordinary destinations the country has to offer. At the moment, Canadians can travel outside their country yet are discouraged from travelling within Canada by a confusing patchwork of provincial restrictions, while even vaccinated international travellers remain prohibited from travelling to Canada. This simply doesn't make sense. The travel industry has adopted extraordinary measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Marriott has spent the past 16 months implementing heightened hygiene and safety protocols as part of our ""Commitment to Clean,"" investing in ""touchless"" technologies, and refining fundamental guest service procedures that have been industry hallmarks for nearly 100 years. We know that re-introducing travel requires a serious and committed effort - and we are not alone. The interdependency between hotels, airlines, cruise lines, national and provincial parks, destination attractions, and more means we operate within a web of carefully woven strings. Destinations that lose airline connectivity will inevitably see declines in economic viability as other industries fall by the wayside. Destinations that allow airline arrivals, but have limited, or no operating hotels will see a decline in visitation - and ultimately consumer spending. In non-pandemic times, one in 10 jobs is related to the Canadian tourism industry. Without a thriving travel industry, Canadians cannot return to work, and life, as they desire them.

The positive effects of travel on our mental health and social well-being cannot be overstated. The ""stay home"" mantra has certainly impacted people's psyches. But travel is at the heart of how connections are made, how business gets done and how we learn, explore and discover. Travel has a transformative power as a vital pathway to growth, healing, and unity. We have become comfortable with the discomfort of the last 16 months. But we are meant to experience the world, not shy away from it. We and our travel and tourism peers are ready to welcome travellers. Governments will rely on our industry to help bolster Canada's economic vitality. We hope they will start shifting the conversation and allow us to do just that.

Opinion: Increased rapid antigen testing a plus for COVID-19 toolkit,https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-increased-rapid-antigen-testing-can-be-a-plus-in-covid-19-toolkit,leaderpost.com,"Rapid testing important, but needs to be done frequently to make a difference, writes Peter W.B. Phillips.",['Peter W.B. Phillips'],2021-02-26 00:00:00,"Opinion: Increased rapid antigen testing can be a plus in COVID-19 toolkit Opinion: Increased rapid antigen testing can be a plus in COVID-19 toolkit Photo by Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press Governments everywhere seem to have run out of strategies for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Doubling down on shelter-in-place policies are a tacit admission that all our public health measures - surveillance, quarantine for travellers, isolation for infected individuals, mass testing, vaccination, and hospitalization - are not up to the task. So is that it? I believe there is at least one tool on the shelf that we have not yet used fully: Antigen testing for use at point-of-care. We were quite enthusiastic about this approach back in the fall. Health Canada in October to December approved six different tests from three companies and the federal government contracted for 38 million rapid test kits. At least 3.8 million are in Canada and in the last few weeks they have begun to be distributed to provinces but so far few have been deployed. Opinion: Increased rapid antigen testing can be a plus in COVID-19 toolkit A few pilot studies have been tried at airports, bars and some workplaces but general uptake has stalled. Only on Thursday did the Saskatchewan government announce a plan to expand rapid testing with the use of 700,000 kits. Currently, we use nucleic acid technology lab-based test, which involves drawing a sample from the back of your throat with a swab and sending it for genetic analysis in a laboratory. These tests detect almost all infected individuals and are vital parts of our clinical treatment of COVID-19. The problem is the laboratory analysis takes about six hours and, with the transport and logistics of getting the samples to the labs, most people are only hearing results at best 24 to 48 hours after the sample is taken. In that time, they could be infecting others. Clearly, these tests are not fast enough to help in managing the disease in our daily affairs. We need to actively test where the diseases are incubating. Our testing protocols for the most part seem to rely on individuals to self-identify for testing. Asymptomatic individuals and those with minor symptoms remain socially active and add to the growth in cases. This is where rapid tests fit. When Health Canada regulators evaluated and approved these tests, they judged that they were anywhere from 83.2 per cent to 96.7 per cent effective, delivering results at the point-of-care in as little as 15 minutes. The problem is that recent field-testing suggests that they may be far less effective than that. The U.S. Centres for Disease Control reported on a study of a test population of 1,098 people, nucleic acid lab-based tests identified 54 people with infections while the rapid antigen test detected only 38 of these people (many with one or more symptom). The antigen test failed to detect 16 people who were infected (most who were asymptomatic) and also falsely detected 18 people as infected who weren't. That is about a 70 per cent success rate. When the test results for the asymptomatic population were isolated, the rate of successful detection of infected people dropped to just over 40 per cent. As a one-time test, that isn't overly impressive and few places are using the test. These tests, if used more intensively, could go a long way to managing the virus. All the testing was done only once. If 70 per cent effective tests were administered to an isolated group of people not once but daily for an extended period, and all positives (correct or false) were isolated, the test would detect all the infected people within four days. If we take the worst-case scenario and assume only about 40 per cent success, within 10 days all infected individuals would be detected. Obviously, this is simple math on a static population. The virus actually is more dynamic. Over time, the viral load for infected individuals would increase daily, making detection easier, which suggests this might be a worst-case scenario. Offsetting that, people would be getting infected outside these settings, so there would be a sustained flow of new infection. Simulations suggest that repeated antigen testing could control infections in a workplace or long-term care facility to the rate of infections introduced from outside the group. The spread of the virus inside these settings would effectively be halted. So even a weak test can add to our tool kit. Implemented aggressively in high density places, such as larger workplaces, long-term care and seniors homes, schools and larger retail outlets (where Ontario reports more than 60 per cent of the infections are emerging), we would go a long way to identifying infected individuals that could then be isolated and treated, breaking the infection chain more effectively than under our current system. Lowering the overall infection and reproduction rate in workplaces and care homes, would help to lower mortality, minimize the costs of infections and reduce losses from economic disruption. This is a win-win-win strategy, especially when we realize that we actually have bought and paid for these tests and they are already in Canada and available for use. Peter W.B.

Flood']",2021-05-17 00:00:00,"Opinion: It's no longer a question of whether Canada should have vaccine passports - but how they should be designed Opinion: It's no longer a question of whether Canada should have vaccine passports - but how they should be designed Photo by DADO RUVIC / REUTERS The question of whether Canada should create COVID-19 vaccine passports was answered by Health Minister Patty Hadju last week, when she confirmed that the federal government will create such a system to allow Canadians to travel internationally again. Now is the time to consider who in Canada will provide such passports, and how they should be designed and deployed. Opinion: It's no longer a question of whether Canada should have vaccine passports - but how they should be designed Vaccine passports of one design or another are already in operation in several places around the world, including Israel, Denmark, China, Mexico and Lebanon. The European Union is developing one and so is the UK, and New York has its own system. In these and other places, vaccine passports are helping to bring life back to normal, while facilitating domestic and international travel. For all these benefits, there are good reasons for Canadians to be concerned about the privacy impacts of vaccine passports. History teaches us that measures enacted to respond to emergencies are often ""sticky."" Income tax was introduced as a temporary measure during the First World War, yet last week, millions of Canadians filed their annual returns. Correspondingly, privacy campaigners have expressed concerns that a passport system used to check our vaccination status before entering a store or a concert venue during COVID times could form the backbone of a long-lasting system of location-based surveillance. These are legitimate concerns, but our research makes clear that choices can be made in the design characteristics of a vaccine passport system and the rules governing their use to avert them. We can make a vaccine passport that maximizes public health benefits while minimizing privacy and other human rights impacts. To do this, several critical questions need to be addressed at the outset. First, who should be permitted to issue vaccination passports? The private sector is taking the lead in many countries and regions. If governments in Canada don't act, likely the private sector will introduce vaccine passports here too, raising a host of worries relating to equity, discrimination and privacy. If we want access to vaccine passports for all who qualify, governments need to issue passports themselves or regulate the incipient market in vaccine passports. Second, what information should vaccine passports include? Concerns that vaccine passports could be used to track our movements are very real. But to do so, they would need to encode information about our identity - like our name, or a unique identifier, like our Social Insurance Number (SIN). As a matter of principle, vaccine passports should collect as little information about us as possible, possibly not even containing our names. This is known as ""data minimization."" Finally, what technological form will the passports take? Most proposals call for digital passports as scannable QR codes or an app on your phone. But digital systems make it easy to collect and store data about the use of vaccine passports, forever. By contrast, paper-based systems could be better at protecting privacy. Flashing a paper-based passport at a security guard does not risk creating the permanent data trail that scanning a digital credential might. Yet it may be possible to develop a digital passport system that leverages the technologies found in contact-tracing apps to help protect our privacy. We should also consider who can ask to see your vaccine passport; how vaccine passports will be verified and validated when they are presented to gain access to a place or a service; and what information can be collected and stored whenever a passport holder is required to show it. Good policy can mitigate privacy concerns in each case. For example, governments could mandate that entities that are permitted to inspect the vaccine passport may simply verify the information encoded into the passport without retaining it for any purpose. Vaccine passports will of course be opposed by some on principled grounds. We believe, however, that social justice is best advanced by ending the pandemic and restoring normal life as quickly as possible. If vaccine passports can help to do that, then we should call upon our governments to put systems in place with sufficient safeguards for important values, like privacy.

"OPINION: As physicians, mothers and daughters, we have concerns with COVID-19 rules",https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-as-physicians-mothers-and-daughters-we-have-concerns-with-covid-19-rules,torontosun.com,"What if everything we are doing to protect the elderly from coronavirus is causing irreparable harm, including more deaths, to our children?","['Dr. Mary Kestler', 'Dr. Jennifer M. Grant', 'Dr. Martha Fulford', 'Dr. Corinne Hohl']",2020-10-08 00:00:00,"Photo by Stock photo / Getty Images What grandparent would choose to have their grandchild live a life of lower quality or opportunity than they had? What parent would accept that their child's health be harmed as a matter of policy? These may seem like ridiculous questions, but the decision to do all these things is being made on a daily basis in our response to COVID-19. If that is true, we need to discuss if this is what we really want to accomplish. We are not people who want to see older people die. We are physicians, we are mothers and we are daughters. We love our children and we love our parents. We care for COVID-19 patients and see the damage it has done. However, it is with increasing distress that we have watched Canadian decision-makers de-prioritize the legitimate needs of our youth. We write this article out of love and to remind everybody of our responsibility towards creating a society that values the health of all, and especially, of the particular needs of the young, who often have no voice but will take over the reins of our society. We have watched young children be denied free play in parks and community centres, socialization, and education - and with these losses, much needed access to social services for the most vulnerable. Even now, with schools reopened, many schools are not providing the full-time service that our young people deserve and need in order to thrive. Some return to school plans include as little as 105 minutes per day of in-person learning. This limited time is not only inadequate to meet curricular milestones and prepare students for the rigours of university, it also leaves them isolated for hours every day and deprives them of the socialization they need to develop into healthy adults. Almost all universities are offering only online classes and denying access to places on campus that allow social and academic interactions. Youth and young adulthood is the time that people develop the skills and relationships that last their lifetimes. The people we meet in high school, university, at our first job, or wherever else young adulthood brings us, become friends for life. This is also the time we fall in love, fail, and fall in love again with the hope that we will eventually get it right. We learn what real friendship means as we navigate the chasm between childhood and adulthood. Recent years have seen young people increasingly struggle with this transition. The medical and statistical truth is that the young are not at risk from COVID-19. Compared to other common respiratory infections like influenza, COVID-19 is less deadly and less likely to result in hospitalization for those under age 30. For example, influenza claimed the lives of 10 children in Canada under the age of 10 during the 2018-19 flu season. In comparison, COVID-19 has been associated with two deaths under the age of 20 and nine deaths among those between 20 and 29. Further, it's not clear how many of those deaths were due to COVID, rather than due to another cause with COVID as an incidental finding. In fact, the risk of dying of COVID for the young is hundreds of times less than dying of other things, an event which is, mercifully, already rare. While COVID-19 does not pose a significant health threat to children and youth, our response does. Suicides claim the lives of close to 4,000 young Canadians per year. In June 2020, more young Canadians died in one month alone from opioid overdoses than in the entire province of B.C. from COVID-19. But those deaths are not being announced on a daily basis on social media. Increased distress associated with loss of social structure and educational opportunity is predicted to substantially increase this number. Even a 1% increase in suicide would mean 40 more deaths in young people, which is four times more than COVID has claimed. This doesn't include the increase in drownings, deaths due to inability to access medical care, or other unintended consequences. We are also forgetting the enormous economic impact reduced education and increased public debt will impose on our youth. Yet we have demonized young people who wish to socialize. Those who are caught are paraded out on the media for group shaming, or receive hefty fines. We have ensured that the common places that young people would be able to meet are unavailable - schools, universities and athletic venues - especially for those who cannot afford private lessons or clubs. Outdoor places are closed if the young are seen congregating too much, even though these are the places least likely to be associated with disease spread. The costs of restriction are higher, and will last longer, for this group. If anxiety and depression was high already, increased isolation, lack of supports and economic distress will increase it further. In Canada, around 80% of COVID-19 deaths have occurred in nursing homes. The argument to impose restrictions on the young is that if they become infected, the infections will inevitably percolate to the elderly, causing deaths. However, it is not because a 20-year-old university student goes to a seminar with 20 classmates that her grandmother will be infected. There are many opportunities to avoid this, by improving care in nursing homes, ensuring people avoid visiting the elderly when sick, and ensuring that those caring for them have sufficient security that they are not incentivized to come to work while ill. Many will argue that choosing between children and the elderly is a false dichotomy, and it is. There is no reason that we can't ensure our children have what they need while also providing excellent care for our elders. We propose that we do both by ensuring adequate funding for elder care and carefully considering how important it is to ensure the mental, physical and emotional health of the people whom we have pledged our lives to raise and protect. - Dr. Mary Kestler is an infectious diseases specialist and clinical assistant professor in the UBC Faculty of Medicine. - Dr. Jennifer M.

Yet, Health Minister Paul Merriman and Premier Scott Moe still keep our current COVID-19 course . While restrictions were greatly loosened back in July, the present state of COVID-19 in the province has changed since the early summer. It is time to recognize this pandemic reality. Let's be clear: Vulnerable people are dying from COVID-19, and will continue to die unless we act now. Throughout the waves of the pandemic, we have been told that reasonable people would and should listen to public health officials and government public health orders. Wearing a mask, staying socially distant, and getting a vaccine are our best tools to tackle the pandemic. Unfortunately, the silence of the Moe government on these measures speaks volumes. It appears that the Moe government has washed its hands, so to speak, of the pandemic, informing the province that we are now in the time of ""living with COVID"" ( there's even a webpage on the government website dedicated to this fallacious message of personal responsibility ). Is this the message we should be sending to those vulnerable people in our communities who are more likely to die from the virus? This injustice cannot stand. Collective, community responsibility to one another's health and safety will keep our communities healthy and safe overall. Not only do we owe ourselves the chance to get vaccinated, but we owe our neighbours, friends and other community members (whether we know them or not) to get vaccinated too. Opinion: Moe government lacking leadership as fourth wave swamps Saskatchewan At what point do we hold the Moe government accountable for its lack of health orders? Where is the tipping point that will allow the Moe government to reinstitute mandatory indoor mask usage ? How many preventable deaths from COVID-19 will the Moe government allow before action is taken? The overwhelming evidence suggests that COVID-19 measures work, and complicit ignorance of scientific evidence does not; the Moe government must face this truth. The ongoing ignorance and denial quietly (or not so quietly) ushers us toward further peril, suffering and loss. Ignorance and denial are not a diet solely for the ""uneducated."" Its leading proponents are often well educated, peddling to their own political advantage. This ignorance produces doublespeak, half-truths and lies used to justify policies and actions which are in opposition to moral values, integrity and outright decency. Do we stand on the edge of a disastrous cliff, staring into a pandemic abyss in the province? There are many who argue that we do. We are confronted with the catastrophic impacts of weak policymaking and a lack of leadership under the Moe government. We are witnessing a near sociopathic lack of interest in - or compassion and responsibility for - others. As some politicians from across the political spectrum and community leaders across the country continue to promote and introduce vaccine and masking mandates, the coldness and indifference of the Moe government proliferates. It is because of the escalating production and the seeming ubiquity of ignorance that the deepening political, cultural and social coldness from the Moe government will freeze our province in its tracks of getting out of the pandemic. Now is not the time for blatant lies, half-truths, evasions, legalistic sophistries and ideological appeals. Now is the time for clear policy, mandatory mask and vaccine mandates, and leadership from the Moe government. We have come too far in this pandemic to let ignorance and denial win.

Waiting in a small dorm room for your imminent death has a habit of focusing the mind, as I'm sure many in Italy are discovering this week. I believe our officials are well-meaning, and compared to the disorganized disaster in America, we are doing well. But those of us in hospitals waiting for a massive crush of patients in the next few days are very worried that we are simply not ready for what's coming. What happened in China, and now Italy, should have focused minds and led to changes here - but sadly not enough is being done. They key is hospital bed - especially critical care/ICU bed - capacity. The virus may leave younger people with only a runny nose and cough, but can be devastating for older folks - especially those above 60. We could see an entire generation - our parents, grandparents, our collective memory - devastated by this illness. About 20% of those infected will need some kind hospital care, from just getting oxygen support or antibiotics. Ontario hospital beds are already well over 100% capacity, and we would need five to 10 times that to take care of the potentially ill. Critical care beds, meaning those with ventilators, are in even shorter supply. We could buy thousands of ventilators (vendors have them ready to go) or get lay people trained, but that hasn't been done. Hospitals and clinics are running out of masks. Like Taiwan, we could have gotten factories here to mass produce masks (they're not an especially difficult item to produce,) but we didn't do it. How sad is it that Canada - the biggest pulp-paper producer in the world - has to beg for masks shipped from Asia? The public needs to be prepared for what lies ahead. Most of us will be fine but we all will need to make adjustments in our daily routines … discourage mass gatherings, convince employers to let us work from home, set up grocery delivery, set up video calling with our relatives, doctors and others, get your church to do their sermon virtually, and become accustomed to wearing a simple paper mask outside of the home. Sadly, I see no evidence that our government is preparing the population for any of this. Watching the ultra-competent actions of officials in Israel, Korea, Taiwan and others frankly makes me depressed. Singapore residents receive twice-daily text alerts from officials with information and warnings, reassuring people and getting them involved in protecting themselves and others. Taiwan and Israel blocked and quarantined travelers in early January, while South Korea does great public education and began mass testing weeks ago - even commandeering hotels to isolate sick patients.

NP View: An Alberta court's wrongheaded order to compel anti-vaxxers to refute their own opinions,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/np-view-an-alberta-courts-wrongheaded-order-to-compel-anti-vaxxers-to-refute-their-own-opinions,nationalpost.com,"This decision sounds an awful lot like compelled speech, something that Canadian law has correctly treated as equal to the suppression of speech",['National Post View'],2021-10-10 00:00:00,"Photo by Brendan Miller/Postmedia In the long run, newspapers get only the freedom of speech protections they deserve. And what they deserve is determined by what they advocate for others in their pages. So we would like to express surprise and alarm at actions reportedly taken on Wednesday by an Alberta Court of Queen's Bench judge. Judge Adam Germain was ruling on punishments for three notorious anti-vaxxers: brothers Artur and Dawid Pawlowski, who lead a church in Calgary, and Christopher Scott, owner of a cafe in the central Alberta hamlet of Mirror. The trio have become the obnoxious leaders of an anti-vaccination movement in Alberta, and had defied court orders by holding large, maskless gatherings at their establishments to preach lucrative, theatrical nonsense. The judge, explicitly wishing to avoid making martyrs of the men, gave them large fines and sentenced them to probation. This is not the problem - indeed, it could be argued that this component of the penalty is too soft. (It might also be pointed out that, to some Canadians, the three are already established martyrs.) There are obvious civil-liberties dimensions to the control of the COVID-19 pandemic by public authorities, but violating a court order during an infectious-disease emergency both invites and deserves punishment. Yet observers of the hearing noticed that the judge seemed to be dissatisfied with his own leniency, and he unexpectedly waxed creative, issuing an order that the men, in lecturing or preaching from now on, must include a disclaimer stating that their ideas about vaccines are in conflict with the scientific consensus and majority medical opinion. As several charter experts observed after hearing of the decision, this sounds an awful lot like compelled speech, something that Canadian law has correctly treated as equal to the suppression of speech, and is tantamount to the improvised creation of an official scientific credo. Even in commercial settings, our courts are, under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, reluctant to allow authorities to require mandatory public-health messages that bear the imprint of the government. In its 1995 decision in the case of RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada , for example, the Supreme Court struck down a section of the Tobacco Products Control Act compelling ""unattributed health warnings,"" saying it was ""inconsistent with the right of freedom of expression as set out is 2(b) of the charter."" More recently, though it did not relate to public health, there was the successful litigation over the Ontario government's mandatory gas-pump stickers describing the federal carbon tax. In this case, orators - and, in the Pawlowskis' case, preachers of religion - are being required by a court to contradict or refute their own opinions. The charter's free expression guarantees, Supreme Court Justice Jean Beetz wrote in 1984, ""must prohibit compelling anyone to utter opinions that are not his own""; to do otherwise is ""totalitarian and as such alien to the tradition of free nations like Canada."" The judge was supposed to be penalizing the defendants for their actions in defiance of law - not their anti-vaccine opinions, which, however mistaken or foolish, are entitled to the most punctilious charter protection. In enforcing a court order, Judge Germain perhaps has more latitude than a government would. But even if his choice of penalty could find some purchase in the law on appeal, it is a gift to the vendors of pseudoscience he was chastising. Among those suspicious of vaccine mandates and the medications themselves, the judge's action might create the impression that the defendants' sin was in saying the wrong thing and defying the medical establishment, rather than in making physical headway for deadly pathogens. He may be unwittingly contributing to an ongoing public health disaster in the West. If he thought himself clever for having done this, or deemed himself privately to be striking some sort of heroic blow on behalf of science, we would beseech him to reconsider.

Opinion: Yellow stars at protests are 'shameful and an affront',https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/opinion-yellow-stars-at-protests-are-shameful-and-an-affront,montrealgazette.com,It is absurd for anyone to compare the current pressures to get vaccinated with what my mom and other Holocaust survivors endured.,['Jack Jedwab'],2021-10-10 00:00:00,"Photo by Dave Sidaway / Montreal Gazette A recent protest in Montreal against COVID-19 vaccination requirements saw several people wearing the yellow Star of David, wanting to compare their so-called plight with Jewish people in Europe during the Holocaust. It was not the first time the stars were seen at these rallies, here and elsewhere. Appropriating the Star of David to make the case against vaccine passports or other public health measures is shameful and an affront to the 6 million Jews who died at the hands of the Nazis and those who survived. By engaging in these unacceptable analogies, the protesters do not help their already difficult case. Comparing their situation with the horrors that Jews encountered during the Second World War reflects a profound ignorance about the Holocaust. The protesters would be well served to hear from those who experienced persecution under the Nazi regime. French Holocaust survivor Joseph Szwarc was appalled by the sight of the yellow stars at protests in France. ""You can't imagine how much that upset me,"" he said. ""This comparison is hateful."" Former Nazi-hunter Serge Klarsfeld stressed that ""the yellow star was a symbol of death that excluded Jews from society and marked them for extermination, while vaccines, on the other hand, save lives."" Most of the world's Holocaust survivors are in their 80s or 90s, and many suffer from a wide range of medical issues. Hence, they face a particularly high risk of serious illness from exposure to the coronavirus. Holocaust survivors and their family members are grateful for the availability of the vaccines, which have saved many lives in Canada and elsewhere. One such survivor is my mother, Bella Jedwab, who was in the ghetto in Lodz, Poland, where she was forced to wear the yellow Star of David. Today, she resides at a long-term care facility in Montreal. Many such institutions had to deal with the spread of the virus, and my mom's facility was no exception. A number of residents were infected, and tragically some died under very difficult circumstances. Thankfully all residents of the facility are now fully vaccinated. I wasn't able to see my mom for an extended period of time because of the lockdown measures that were adopted, and rightly so, to protect her and others. My family remains grateful for the care my mom received in this difficult period. Without the vaccine, my mom would have continued to be isolated for an even greater length of time. Hence, my family and I were quite ready to get vaccinated so that we could resume the visits that she so very much appreciates. We also wanted to protect each other and those people with whom we come into contact. It is the responsible thing to do to help keep everyone as safe as possible. Over the years my mom had the opportunity to relate to us the many things she experienced and witnessed during the war. There was an ongoing scarcity of food and limited access to hygiene. There was the widespread tragic separation and loss of many friends and loved ones under the Nazi regime. Such analogies are offensive, and those who make them render their case unworthy of any serious consideration.

"Battered by public opinion, Liberal government says it tried to get COVID-19 vaccines made in Canada",https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2021/02/04/battered-by-public-opinion-liberal-government-says-it-tried-to-get-covid-19-vaccines-made-in-canada.html,www.thestar.com,The minister responsible for Canada's COVID-19 vaccine acquisitions is defending Ottawa’s strategy as a new poll suggests many Canadians are blaming t...,"['Jacques Gallant', 'Legal Affairs Reporter']",2021-02-04 00:00:00,"The minister responsible for Canada's COVID-19 vaccine acquisitions is defending Ottawa's strategy as a new poll suggests many Canadians are blaming the Liberal government for its slow pace. Procurement and Public Services Minister Anita Anand says her department asked vaccine manufacturers last year if they could make their products in Canada, but was turned down because the pharmaceutical companies said this country did not have the necessary infrastructure. Anand's revelation to a House of Commons committee on Thursday came amid delivery disruptions of the two vaccines so far authorized for use in Canada, both of which are manufactured abroad, and just before the release of a public opinion survey in which the Liberal government fared poorly. Anand also told the committee that Canada's contracts with vaccine makers guarantee the number of doses the country will get per quarter, and not per week. While Canada has been guaranteed four million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and two million Moderna doses by the end of March, questions remain about exactly when those shipments will arrive, raising the ire of the provinces, which say the delays are making it difficult to plan a proper vaccination strategy. Within an hour of Anand's statement to the committee, Maj.-Gen. Dany Fortin, the military commander heading up Ottawa's vaccine rollout, said Canada does not yet know how many doses of the Moderna vaccine it will be receiving in its next shipment, which is scheduled for the last week of February. All this comes as a new Abacus Data poll shows Canadians losing faith in the federal government's ability to handle the vaccine rollout. The poll, scheduled for release Friday, found that 42 per cent of respondents thought Ottawa has done a ""poor/terrible"" job when it comes to ordering vaccines the country needs, while 48 per cent said the government is doing terribly at making sure Canadians receive the vaccines in a timely fashion. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he's been reassured that European Union export controls on vaccines will not endanger Canada's shipments. When asked Thursday why Canada isn't on the list of countries that are exempt from the export controls, Anand said she had ""raised this question myself,"" and said it's an issue her cabinet colleagues continue to work on with the EU. The government has faced criticism for Canada's lack of domestic capacity to produce vaccines, which critics say was allowed to erode over the years under both the Liberals and Conservatives. That capacity is only now starting to ramp up but will not be in place by September, when Trudeau has promised that every Canadian who wants a vaccine will have received one. The government announced last week that it signed a memorandum of understanding with American-based firm Novavax to produce its COVID-19 vaccine, which has not yet been approved by Health Canada. But the National Research Council facility in Montreal that is expected to produce the vaccine is still under construction, and will need to be certified by Health Canada. Vaccine production there is expected to begin by the end of 2021. Anand told the committee Thursday that her department ""proactively and repeatedly approached leading vaccine manufacturers"" last year about making their products in Canada. ""The manufacturers reviewed the identified assets here in Canada and concluded that biomanufacturing capacity in this country at the time of contracting, which was last August and September, was too limited to justify the investment of capital and expertise to start manufacturing in Canada,"" Anand said. She added ""that is not to say the window is closed,"" pointing to the ongoing discussions with Novavax as an example. Meanwhile, Fortin told a news conference that Canada received 180,000 Moderna doses Thursday morning, which was less than the 230,000 initially expected in this week's shipment. He said it's unclear at this point how many Moderna doses will be received in the next shipment the week of Feb. 22, but that it will be less than the 249,000 originally expected. Fortin reiterated that Canada still expects 2 million doses from Moderna by the end of March. He said there's been no indication from the company of production problems. ""Moderna has indicated that they are in good faith trying to do their best to provide as many doses as possible as fairly and equitably to their market,"" Fortin said. ""They haven't shared the specifics of challenges that they may experience in their yields or in their production."" Pfizer shipments have also been hit in recent weeks with delivery issues as the company retooled its plant in Belgium. Fortin said that 79,000 Pfizer doses were received this week and about 70,000 are expected next week. He said the company has indicated it would be scaling up later this month, with shipments forecast to be about 335,000 doses in the week of Feb. 15 and 395,000 in the week of Feb. 22. To date, just over 1 million Pfizer and Moderna doses have been administered in Canada, according to federal health officials, although only about 113,000 people have so far received the two doses required to achieve maximum protection."

No, prepare for multiple worsts - and better scenarios, too Photo by Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press By Sean Speer, Drew Fagan and Michael Cuenco The COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt our economy and society. Government budgets are no exception. Falling revenues and rising pandemic-related spending have resulted in massive deficits at the federal and provincial levels. Opinion: Prepare for the worst? No, prepare for multiple worsts - and better scenarios, too The pandemic also has brought unprecedented uncertainty. This isn't a rhetorical point. There are organizations and researchers who use different methodologies to track uncertainty over time. They find that the level of uncertainty in recent months has been the highest ever recorded in Canada, the United States and elsewhere. This uncertainty makes it extremely difficult for governments to produce reliable economic and fiscal projections. In particular, it makes it challenging to estimate how much revenue they'll bring in and how much they'll spend on health care and other front-line departments in the fight against the pandemic. The pandemic has brought unprecedented uncertainty As a result, Canadian governments have delayed the release of their 2020 budgets. Instead, the federal and provincial governments have produced short-term fiscal updates and sought legislative approval for emergency spending on an as-needed basis. The strategy was ostensibly to wait until the situation had stabilized. But the situation hasn't markedly improved. A recent spike in cases and new rounds of business restrictions have health experts speculating about a ""long, dark winter."" The need to live with uncertainty is the one certainty that policy-makers and the public can anticipate for foreseeable future. It's against this backdrop that Ontario Finance Minister Rod Phillips is set to release his government's budget on Thursday . It will take stock of the pandemic's impact on Ontario's public finances and provide Ontarians with an update on the government's plan to address the pandemic's economic and public health challenges. Photo by John Lappa/Postmedia News The pandemic, including the uncertainty it has wrought, has already contributed to a significant worsening of Ontario's bottom line. The government's own-source revenue projections fell by more than $10 billion between March and August 2020. Expenditures jumped by $20 billion over the same time frame. The effect was a six-fold increase in the province's current deficit in barely five months. The Ontario government won't be able to eliminate uncertainty in its forthcoming budget. But there are steps it can take to mitigate its effects and, in turn, to minimize the risk that the deficit climbs even further. As we outline in a new paper for Ontario 360, a research project at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, one of the most useful ways in which the provincial government - or any government, for that matter - can address uncertainty in its budget is to adopt ""scenario analysis."" This is a prudent approach in light of current circumstances It sounds wonky but the basic idea is straightforward. Normally, governments rely on a single set of economic and fiscal forecasts as the foundation of their budgets. Scenario analysis would have them produce a range of scenarios that reflect the level of uncertainty in the economy. This is a prudent approach in light of current circumstances. The risk of reliance on a single economic and fiscal outlook is that it gets overtaken by events and the budget is rendered, for all intents and purposes, useless from an accountability and public reporting perspective. The government's fiscal credibility would be seriously harmed in the eyes of bond markets, credit rating agencies and the general public. Scenario analysis, by contrast, would have the government produce different economic and fiscal scenarios - a base case, an upside case, and a downside case, most typically - that provide it with more fiscal flexibility in such a fluid environment. This protects the government's budget against significant changes in the public-health and economic environments and sets the stage for the government to propose different policy responses contingent on the different scenarios. Scenario analysis and contingency planning can contribute to greater public confidence Scenario analysis and contingency planning can contribute to greater public confidence that the government has a proactive plan rather than a series of reactive responses to the evolving pandemic. Sustaining such confidence will be crucial as any government continues to make difficult choices in order to manage the pandemic. Peer jurisdictions are using scenario analysis and contingency planning to mitigate uncertainty and shore up public confidence. The Eurozone, for instance, has experimented with this budgeting approach amid the pandemic. So much is outside of the Ontario government's control as it prepares to release its budget this week. But it can control how it takes into account today's unprecedented uncertainty.

Opinion: Closing some of U.S.-Canada land border could help control COVID-19,https://theprovince.com/opinion/opinion-closing-some-of-u-s-canada-land-border-could-help-control-covid-19,theprovince.com,"A more coherent Canadian strategy on border management requires consistency in the measures applied for air, land and sea arrivals.",['Kelley Lee'],2021-03-14 00:00:00,"Opinion: Photo by Elaine Thompson / AP During the COVID-19 pandemic, attention to travel measures has largely focused on air travel. This includes the potential use of ""vaccine passports"" to open up international borders again. However, for countries with extensive land borders, there are special challenges. Canada and the U.S. share the world's longest undefended land border. While the U.S. is Canada's most important trading partner, it's also the world's epicentre for coronavirus infections and deaths. COVID-19 variants of concern are now present in almost all U.S. states. The spread of these variants in the U.S. points to the need for Canada to review the adequacy of public health risk management at land crossings. Since March 21, 2020, non-essential travel has been restricted at Canada-U.S. land crossings. Outbound travel for Canadian nationals and permanent residents, and inbound and outbound travel for non-nationals (except Alaska-bound U.S. citizens), aren't permitted. On Jan. 29, 2021, the Canadian government announced new measures for non-essential travel in response to variants of concern. Arrivals by air now have testing and hotel quarantine requirements, and those by land have testing requirements but can self-quarantine or isolate. Given that hundreds-of-thousands of essential and non-essential travellers continue to enter Canada by land each month, differences in policy for air and land travel have been questioned. According to Canadian Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, the main reason for this difference is logistics. With 117, two-way land crossings, comparable measures ""simply aren't possible, given the existing infrastructure that's available."" As a team of travel health and pandemic experts, we suggest that there are solutions to this seemingly insurmountable challenge. There are insufficient resources to provide screening, testing and quarantine measures at all land crossings comparable with air arrivals. Based on our study of travel-related measures during COVID-19, one option is to substantially reduce the number of crossings kept open. This is similar to the funnelling of air arrivals through four airports, and has been a successful strategy in other countries. After closing some land crossings, the government can then designate selected crossings for incoming non-essential travel only. This prevents bottlenecks hindering essential travel. Given around seven per cent of land crossings during the pandemic are deemed non-essential, and that the volume of land travel has declined by around 90 per cent during the pandemic, temporarily closing some border crossings is also practical. Crossings remaining open for non-essential travellers should be those that had higher vehicle volumes pre-pandemic such as the Peace Arch and Rainbow Bridge, Ont. High traffic crossings already have the necessary inbound and outbound road networks to allow ease-of-access. They generally also have hotels nearby. This can enable an extension of mandatory quarantine at designated sites for travellers entering by land. These crossings should also be within a reasonable driving distance of a hospital should there be a need for health care. The border crossings themselves would need to have sufficient staff to accommodate any enhancements made to testing protocols. By streamlining land border crossings, on-site public health resources available can be tailored to specific types of travellers. For non-essential travel, alongside enhanced screening, testing and quarantine, arrivals should be provided with tailored information. For example, in the coming weeks thousands of ""snowbirds"" are expected to return to Canada by land. These long-stay travellers should be directed to reliable sources of information regarding vaccine rollout in their province as many will fall within priority groups. Those who were inoculated abroad should be given details on how to register this information in their personal vaccination record. Transport workers comprise a large proportion of essential travellers crossing by land. The World Economic Forum ranks transport workers as being at highest risk among about 950 non-health occupations during COVID-19. Many Canadian truckers have been concerned about potential exposure to the coronavirus in the U.S. and risk of infecting family members upon their return. We agree with calls for transport workers to be vaccinated as a priority group. In the meantime, rapid-testing should be provided at land crossings designated to serve essential travellers. At a time when COVID-19 and its worrisome variants are being brought into Canada via travel, reducing points of entry has several benefits. Limiting the number of crossings enables us to concentrate resources and enhance public health risk management. This would also facilitate any plans to introduce more testing or even vaccine passports for essential travel. And the incentive for travellers to circumvent air travel measures by diverting to land crossings would be reduced.

Opinion: Protect your kids against COVID-19 with vaccinations,https://leaderpost.com/opinion/opinion-protect-your-kids-against-covid-19-with-vaccinations,leaderpost.com,"As physicians and as parents, our message is simple: Get your child vaccinated, say Dr. Eben Strydom and Dr. Myles Deutscher.","['Dr. Myles Deutscher', 'Dr. Eben Strydom']",2021-11-26 00:00:00,"As physicians and as parents, our message is simple: Get your child vaccinated. Health Canada's approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children aged five to 11 is another crucial step toward leaving the pandemic behind and returning to normal. First, though, eligible children must get their shots in sufficient numbers to protect both themselves and our communities. We have seen the social and physical devastation wrought by the fourth wave of the pandemic in deaths and hospitalizations, as well as proof of vaccination requirements and restrictions, including limits on visitors to our loved ones in care homes. The fourth wave, spurred by the highly contagious Delta variant, appears to be subsiding. We should now do all we can to curtail a potential fifth wave this winter from Delta or other variants. Vaccinations have protected many and have mitigated deaths and hospitalizations. The approval for children aged five to 11 could be a game changer for all of us for the future. That might be an overused cliche, but it fits. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been rigorously reviewed by Health Canada. The vaccine's approval for children was comprehensive and thorough. However, we understand why parents have concerns about vaccinating their children - we all want to do what is best for them. Children may also have questions. We urge parents to talk to their kids openly and honestly, and seek answers from trusted sources such as health professionals. We have learned that 12- to 17-year-olds who have received shots experienced minor side effects such as arm pain, fatigue, headache and fever. These effects are short-lived. Side effects in younger children have been minor to date, and as family physicians we will be monitoring the data closely. We repeat: Please talk to your family doctor or primary care provider about your concerns."
Opinion: COVID-19 vaccination is a must for medical students,https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/opinion-covid-19-vaccination-is-a-must-for-medical-students,montrealgazette.com,"Not only does vaccination protect us, our family members and colleagues, it is the single most important thing medical workers can do to protect their patients.",['Zhida Shang'],2021-03-03 00:00:00,"Photo by John Mahoney / Montreal Gazette files August is an exciting time for many incoming medical students, since we are set to begin our long journeys as physicians. One of the requirements prior to matriculation is to have our immunizations up to date, such as hepatitis B, tetanus and MMR (measles, mumps and rubella), among others. As I am discussing this with my fellow incoming students in medical schools across Canada, we can't help but notice that one item is missing for many of us: COVID-19 vaccinations. This begs the question: Why? Why is vaccination for hepatitis B or measles mandatory for medical students, but not COVID-19? Why do people have no qualms asking about vaccination status for varicella, but when we ask about COVID-19, it suddenly becomes a contentious privacy issue? All the above transmissible diseases may lead to very serious conditions, even with proper medical support. However, COVID-19 is just as or even more deadly, and has been the main topic of international discourse over the past year and a half. As incoming members of the health-care field, it will be our duty to prevent the transmission of deadly diseases for our patients and our communities, and thus it should also be the duty of medical schools to protect their students. So why is it that asking for COVID-19 vaccination is still such a loaded question and complex issue? Why is there such a large double standard regarding COVID-19 vaccination status, at a time when we need it the most? As an incoming Montreal student with no formal medical training, I could be biased in many of my assessments, but to the best of my knowledge, COVID-19 vaccination should not be optional or strongly recommended for medical students - it should be mandatory. COVID-19 vaccines are largely known to be safe and effective and are key in the fight against the pandemic. Canada has many of the world's leading medical learning institutes, but barring prospective changes, few of the country's post-secondary facilities explicitly require students to have proof of COVID-19 vaccination. The arguments against mandatory vaccination are that it infringes upon an individual's autonomy, that there are very few people in universities who are vulnerable and that more than 70 per cent of eligible Canadians are vaccinated. Although these are compelling arguments, and respect for an individual's autonomy and rights is a key component of liberal democracies, it is an entirely different case for medical students and health-care workers. Furthermore, all these arguments can also apply to vaccination for other serious illnesses, but we do not see the same amount of scrutiny. Being part of the medical community requires an attitude of responsibility and professionalism that is unique to our field. We have a mandate to protect ourselves, but the very soul of medicine is also to protect our patients. Not only does vaccination protect us, our family members and colleagues, it is the single most important thing we can do to protect our patients. Medical students are in the midst of learning how to care for others, including those who may be immunocompromised, elderly and generally more susceptible to the adverse effects of COVID-19. If we as students are not fully vaccinated, we run the risk of harming others during our education. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact globally, and medical education is no exception. However, now that vaccinations are leading the recovery around the world, medical schools should be adopting and promoting this drive. There will always be the reluctant and hesitant during any pandemic or health emergency, but this should never be the case for medical school administrators. We are here to promote the countering of misinformation and guide people toward decisions that protect the health and safety of others. Therefore, to ensure the health and safety of myself, my colleagues, my mentors and my future patients, I call on all medical schools to take responsible action and implement a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination program for all students and staff at the earliest possible time.

The vaccine is important; many children have become sick already. Alberta Health reports that almost 21,000 children in the province aged five to nine have become ill with COVID-19. That is a lot of sick children - more than the population of a town. (High River, for example, has about 14,000 residents. ) In Canada, children five to 11 years of age have had more confirmed COVID infection in the fourth wave than any other age group. Worse, 17 children under 18 years in Canada have died . The acceptable number of child and youth deaths from COVID is 0. Opinion: 10 reasons to book a COVID-19 vaccination appointment for your child Vaccinating your child will help prevent your child from contracting the virus. The vaccine is 90.7 per cent effective in preventing coronavirus infection. Vaccinating your child will prevent them from having severe disease and potentially dying. Since the pandemic began, 44 Alberta children have been admitted to hospital and 15 have been in intensive care. These very sick children require dedicated medical attention to survive very severe COVID-19. Such children can have inflammation of the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain or other organs, or a loss of taste and smell, which can have mental health implications. Children can also develop long-term complications, such as ""long COVID,"" with symptoms lingering for months. As we learn more about COVID-19 over time, we will know whether having contracted the virus might have fatal complications for people 20 years later, as measles can have . Vaccinating your child means that your child won't have to quarantine. Alberta Health recommends that an unvaccinated person who comes in contact with a COVID patient at home should stay home for 14 days. This is very disruptive for kids and their households. Vaccinating your child will help other people because vaccinated people rarely infect others. Infected children can accidentally infect their teachers, parents or grandparents. They can accidentally infect immunocompromised people in their lives. Because children five to 11 are now the highest risk group for infection in Alberta. It is inconceivable that they are not now infecting others. We have already imposed a major sacrifice on kids by disrupting school, wearing masks and social distancing to protect the community; vaccination is trivial by comparison. Vaccinating your child to protect others is ethical because doing so helps reduce the incidence of disease, helping us ""return to normal."" Resumption of normal routine and access to peers will improve child and youth mental health. Dr. Chris Wilkes, a Calgary psychiatrist, has reported a ""crisis in terms of a demand on our services that is outstripping our resources."" Vaccinating your child can help reduce the pediatric mental health crisis. Vaccinating your child will help take away one more home for the virus, helping to reduce its ability to live, decreasing the chance of more, perhaps more dangerous, mutations. Vaccinating your child will help your child travel with an older sibling to attend a tournament or competition. No one wants to be the reason that an older sibling can't attend extracurricular activities. Vaccinating your child now against the virus will help everyone enjoy a much happier and more relaxed holiday period than last year. Vaccinating your child against COVID-19 causes only mild discomfort. Community health nurses are experts at giving the shot with the least discomfort and helping parents put their children at ease Vaccinating your child against COVID-19 is safe. In the United States, the COVID vaccine has already been given to about 2.6 million children ages five to 11, with no more than the same minor side effects seen at other ages. We don't expect that this age group will see new side effects because, historically, there has never been a new or dramatic difference in side effects when vaccines have been extended to children. These are 10 great reasons to vaccinate your elementary school child now. To do so, please register online: http://www.alberta.ca/covid19-vaccine or call 811 to book an appointment.

Opinion: Trudeau's quarantine hotels hurt those who need our help the most,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-trudeaus-quarantine-hotels-hurts-those-who-need-our-help-the-most,nationalpost.com,"During a crisis, flailing governments need a scapegoat.

And vacation travellers at Caribbean all-inclusives make a convenient political target for politicians looking to justify draconian measures like hastily announced $2,000 per person quarantine hotel stays. This approach works because there is little public sympathy for people who jetted off to tropical locales while the rest of us freeze at home. Ontario's former finance Minister Rod Phillips can attest to this. But the reality is that many people who travelled during these perilous times are doing so for truly heart-wrenching reasons. And the federal government's clumsy Friday announcement has left these travellers scrambling. The new quarantine measures will require travellers entering Canada to take a PCR test upon arrival, and then quarantine in a government contracted hotel for up to three days, at an estimated cost of over $2,000 per person. Once they receive a negative test result, they are required to self-isolate at home for 14 days. Travellers who test positive are taken to a different government facility to quarantine. During the announcement of this new policy, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Transportation Minister Omar Algahbra focused their talking points on stopping what they call ""non-essential travel"". But days later, it still remains unclear what types of travellers will actually be excluded from the costly quarantine requirement. Minister Alghabra has said the list of exclusions will be extremely narrow. More On This Topic Matt Gurney: Trudeau's mandatory hotel quarantine too late to do much good Incoming travellers will face mandatory hotel quarantine while they await COVID tests: Trudeau This has caused panic among thousands of Canadians who are currently abroad. I know there is a panic, because as the Litigation Director for a legal charity that advocates for the fundamental rights of Canadians, hundreds of them have reached out to me in desperation. I have heard from surgery patients who have travelled to the U.S. at great expense to obtain treatment that is unavailable in Canada, either because it is so specialized or because it has been delayed in Canada. I have heard from the parents of children with severe anaphylaxis who require regular specialized treatment, which is only available at a cutting-edge hospital in California. It is unlikely that a government quarantine facility will adequately meet the needs of individuals recovering from surgery or chemotherapy, or that it can accommodate highly specialized diets. These individuals must be permitted to quarantine at home. But because the government announced the blanket policy without announcing the exclusions, thousands of Canadians are left in a bind. How do you decide what to do when obtaining potentially life-saving therapy for your child requires exposing that child to a potentially life-ending government quarantine facility? Aside from individuals who travel for their own medical treatment, many other Canadians travel to care for others. For example, I have heard from those who have travelled for funerals of family members, or to care for ailing loved ones. These include individuals in cross border relationships. I heard from a woman who experienced a miscarriage alone in her home while her American fiance was in the United States. The cost of him coming to comfort her is now an additional $2,000. Cross border relationships are not uncommon, but now come with an enormous and punitive price-tag. It is unclear whether these individuals will be exempt from the government quarantine hotel requirement. It is irresponsible for the government to release this quarantine policy without clarifying the details, especially when the policy has a dramatic impact on our most fundamental freedoms. Canadians have a Charter protected right to enter, remain in, and leave Canada. We have a right to liberty, to move about freely without obstruction. And we have a right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned. We also have a right to equal benefit and protection of the law. The new federal quarantine policy violates all these fundamental rights. Whether these limits to our rights can be justified will depend on the exact details of the order. But while we await those details, remember that while it may feel good to extract some petty vengeance on sun-seekers, the real impact of this policy is hardest on those who can bear it the least.

"Politics Briefing: Evolving advice on COVID-19 vaccines reflects nature of science, Tam says",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-politics-briefing-evolving-advice-on-covid-19-vaccines-reflects-nature/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"Trudeau tells Canadians that all vaccines approved by Health Canada are judged to be safe and effective, despite NACI opinion that some are “preferred”",['Ian Bailey'],2021-05-04 13:52:45,"Hello, This is the daily Politics Briefing newsletter, written by Ian Bailey. It is available exclusively to our digital subscribers. If you're reading this on the web, subscribers can sign up for the Politics newsletter and more than 20 others on our newsletter signup page. Have any feedback? Let us know what you think. Amidst controversial advice from a national panel on vaccines, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is sticking to his oft-expressed view that vaccines have been properly approved, and Canadians need to take them as quickly as possible to end the pandemic. The issue arose after the National Advisory Committee on Immunization said mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are ""preferred"" because viral-vector vaccines from Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson carry a remote risk of blood clots. There's a story here on how the Canadian Pharmacists Association reacted to the advice. ""I can reinforce once again that every single vaccine available in Canada has been approved by Health Canada as being both safe and effective,"" Mr. Trudeau told a news conference in Ottawa on Tuesday. The Prime Minister avoided a pointed response to the recommendations that have stirred up so much debate. ""It is a good thing that we get to hear from a broad range of medical experts and doctors making recommendations to keep us safe. The bottom line is we need, all of us, [to] get vaccinated as quickly as possible."" Mr. Trudeau said he was ""very happy"" that he got his shot of AstraZeneca. Chief Public Health Officer of Canada Dr. Theresa Tam, asked about the issue at the same news conference, said she can understand why some are concerned or frustrated as ""advice appears to be evolving,"" but noted that is the nature of science and advice. She said various parties, including Health Canada and the immunization advisory committee, are all doing their jobs. ""The bottom line is that everyone should be assured that the regulator, the experts and local medical officers of health have all done their work in a synchronized manner to provide the vaccines to the communities. You should trust that the vaccines being offered to you is done with that best knowledge,"" she said. Dr. Tam said there will be a continued effort to monitor the information around AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson. On another issue, Mr. Trudeau was also asked about his chief of staff, Katie Telford, as the House of Commons, on Tuesday, began debate on a Conservative Opposition Day motion calling for Mr. Trudeau to fire her over her handling of allegations against Jonathan Vance, the former chief of defence staff. Kristy Kirkup and Janice Dickson report on that issue here. Asked about the possibility of Ms. Telford testifying before the commons defence committee, the Prime Minister sidestepped the specific issue, accusing the Conservatives of ""playing extremely aggressive partisan games"" with the issue of sexual harassment in the military. TODAY'S HEADLINES SOCIAL MEDIA AND BILL C-10 The Liberal government is promising amendments to its Broadcasting Act legislation that it says will address concerns that Ottawa is attempting to regulate Canadians' social-media posts. FIREARMS LEGISLATION The federal government's firearms legislation is ""an offensively hollow bill"" that should be completely revamped, say family members and colleagues of those who died in tragic shooting sprees at Montreal's Dawson College and Concordia University. FEDS ACT ON PLANNED ONTARIO HIGHWAY Ottawa is stepping into the approval process of a proposed Ontario highway that would link four Toronto-area municipalities, saying environmental concerns require a closer look. QP CUSSING In the latest House of Commons misadventure with webcams, Government House leader Pablo Rodriguez was caught swearing in Question Period, as opposition MPs grilled the Liberals over their handling of sexual misconduct allegations against former top military commander Jonathan Vance. From the Canadian Press. RCMP MUSEUM The chair of the board of a future national museum focused on the RCMP is pledging to include both positive and challenging stories about Canada's national police force, as it is set to receive $4.5-million over three years from the federal budget. TRUDEAU ON MENTAL HEALTH Sophie Gregoire Trudeau on mental health: Good mental health isn't necessarily about waking up happy every day but, rather, about feeling good about who you are, ""about developing tools to love and respect yourself in a culture that doesn't necessarily teach us that."" From the Montreal Gazette. MINISTER QUARANTINED Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau faces three days of quarantine in a hotel after returning from the first in-person meeting of G7 foreign and development ministers in over two years. From The Canadian Press. PRIME MINISTER'S DAY Private meetings. The Prime Minister holds a news conference on the COVID-19 situation He attends Question Period. He speaks with the Prince of Wales. LEADERS Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-François Blanchet holds a news conference in West Block on vaccine passports. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh holds a pair of news conferences, one on supports for small businesses during the pandemic, and the other on a national dental-care program. Also attends Question Period and hosts a virtual Iftar of Ramadan with community leaders. OPINION The Globe and Mail Editorial Board on user content on social media and Bill C-10: ""Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault has been exasperated lately by the failure of his political opponents to understand that he has nothing but the purest intentions and would never put his name on a bill that gives Ottawa the power to regulate innocent user-generated content on the internet."" Andre Picard (The Globe and Mail) on the increasingly hopeless task of fixing long-term care in Ontario: ""There is nothing surprising or new in the report, though that's not a knock on the commissioners. It's hard to come up with anything groundbreaking when more than 150 reports have been written since the advent of medicare about how to fix the hellishly inadequate long-term care system. There was nothing unexpected in the government's response, either. Blaming previous governments for all failings and making vague commitments to do something, sometime - that's all standard political fare. But at some point, politicians have to stop commissioning reports that they intend to send directly to the dumpster and start implementing the long-overdue and eminently sensible recommendations therein."" Irwin Cotler, Shirin Ebadi and Christophe Deloire (The Globe and Mail) on justice denied the world's longest-imprisoned journalist: ""In 2001, Dawit Isaak was kidnapped by Eritrean authorities in a sweeping roundup of journalists, independent media and government critics. For 19 years, he has been held incommunicado, likely in solitary confinement, without any charge, trial or contact with the outside world. His last ""proof of life"" dates back to 2005. There is reason to believe he has been held in the secret Eiraeiro prison camp in the middle of a mountainous desert with conditions designed to inflict a slow death on its completely isolated political prisoners. At least seven of the journalists arrested with him have already tragically died in detention. Meanwhile, the Eritrean officials responsible for these crimes are still in power. And so today, on World Press Freedom Day, we are calling on Canada and its allies to hold these officials to account and stand up for those fighting to preserve this most fundamental right worldwide."" Drew Hayden Taylor (The Globe and Mail) on seven questions you shouldn't ask an Indigenous person: ""As an Indigenous writer, I used to spend a lot of time on the lecture circuit in pre-COVID times, spreading the gospel of Native literature. Many of the questions I would get from the audience dealt with the art of writing. But habitually, I would be asked questions requiring me to answer on behalf of the entire First Nations population of Canada, all 634 communities, and the more than 1.6 million people in Canada who identify as Indigenous. That's a somewhat substantial responsibility. Full disclosure - I don't personally know all 1.6 million. There are a few hundred in the Northwest Territories who were out of town when I was last up there."" Dale Smith (The Globe and Mail) on the Conservative riding `coup' that was anything but: ""And let's face it: The state of the grassroots in all of Canada's major parties is in rough shape. Canadians have allowed our quasi-presidential-primary-style leadership contests to dominate all aspects of how parties operate, which has empowered party leaders to create top-down structures within their party organizations. As a result, the grassroots have too little say over their own parties any more."" Send along your political questions and we will look at getting answers to run in this newsletter.

"Opinion: To secure future PPE, let's try PPP",https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-to-secure-future-ppe-lets-try-ppp,financialpost.com,Governments should embrace the idea of private supply to ensure Canadian hospitals have the resources they require,"['Roger Bourbonnais', 'Special To Financial Post']",2021-10-06 00:00:00,"Photo by Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press files The COVID-19 pandemic has tested Canada's resiliency and agility in facing a crisis, especially in procuring the right resources and supplies when and where they are needed. One way to address such a supply and distribution gap in future is a private-public sector partnership (PPP), which would allow governments the opportunity to lean on partners, freeing up their time to focus on navigating the country out of a crisis. COVID-19 has demonstrated how beneficial the private sector can be to governments during times of crisis, but it also highlights how ongoing dialogue is essential, even in the relative calm of a recovery. The debates over vaccine nationalism have demonstrated why it's important to have a thriving domestic bio-manufacturing sector. Similarly, the about-face provincial governments made on virtual care last year -adopting it wholesale after years of indecision - illustrates how beneficial collaboration with private-sector vendors can be in giving patients access to the care they require. One can't help but wonder if our response to the pandemic would have been more robust if Canadian governments had been more accustomed to working with industry on domestic emergency preparedness. Consider the federal government's experience trying to procure an adequate supply of personal protective equipment (PPE). As case counts grew in March of 2020 and countries scrambled for access to PPE, Canada started from square one with a national stockpile of largely expired supplies and little to no immediate pipeline to industry. As the Auditor General reported earlier this year, the Public Health Agency of Canada failed to address long-standing problems it had experienced managing the national stockpile and that left the country in a more challenging position when trying to help the provinces and territories gain access to PPE and other emergency-related supplies. The result? In the pandemic's first days, the government had to focus much of its energy on buying supplies, often paying exorbitant prices with no long-term contractual guarantee. Governments at all levels tried to source products from the same international and domestic suppliers. Ultimately, they competed against each other for the same goods, creating hyper-inflated costs and, in many cases, purchasing excessive volumes that will take years to consume - if in fact they don't expire before they're used. More On This Topic William Watson: The conservative temperament Herbert Grubel: If policy lets it, the market will fill all those job vacancies Opinion: Alberta pipelines are bad but foreign oil is fine? Which raises the question: why do we need to rely on government-managed and -operated stockpiles at all? Why not a different model? The concept is simple but it requires an open mind and governments comfortable with collaborating with the private sector. By paying an agreed monthly fee to vendors, governments could have rapid access to a network of PPE that they could tap into during a crisis. Such contracts would function like an insurance policy that would allow governments to receive prioritized access to a guaranteed, in-country supply of PPE categories so they no longer have to maintain stockpiles or manage supply refreshment: that would be the job of vendors, who would maintain excess inventories, manage expiry dates and adhere to regulatory requirements. If such a system had been in place in spring 2020, the federal government would have received a predictable and sustainable supply of PPE at appropriate prices through pre-established pipelines. There would have been no need to hunt for supplies from individual vendors or to re-tool industries with no experience in producing medical-grade supplies and equipment. In future pandemics, better collaboration with industry will allow governments to pre-empt challenges and put safeguards in place to ensure they can focus more attention on other policy matters while managing the country through a crisis. The impact of the pandemic will be felt for years to come, especially in the health system - an area where Canadian governments have been apprehensive about partnering with industry. To avoid the complications of all levels of government trying to procure PPE in a crisis, it would make sense to form an inter-provincial emergency preparedness committee, involving private and public actors alike, to negotiate access to a sufficient supply of PPE to meet the needs of Canadians both federally and provincially. Canadian health systems have an opportunity to lean more on vendors with novel technologies and systems to help ensure necessary supplies are in place during a crisis. Governments should embrace the idea of private supply to ensure that Canadian hospitals and clinics have the resources they require and can select the best tools the private sector has to offer.

A full investigation into Canada’s COVID-19 response is needed now,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-a-full-investigation-into-canadas-covid-19-response-is-needed-now/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"Canadians have a right to a full, fair, independent and public inquiry into the response to this pandemic, and to the lessons and practical reforms such an inquiry will yield.",['Adrian Levy'],2021-11-25 10:00:00,"Adrian Levy is a professor in the department of community health and epidemiology at Dalhousie University in Halifax and a contributing author for the Centre for International Governance Innovation. Chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, was telling Ottawa that 'Canada's risk is much, much lower than that of many countries.'PATRICK DOYLE/Reuters Canadian officials first became aware of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, on Dec. 31, 2019. Yet as late as Jan. 29, 2020, the chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, was telling parliamentarians in Ottawa that ""Canada's risk is much, much lower than that of many countries."" It wasn't until March 21, 2020 - 10 days after the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic - that the federal government adopted international border controls, including screening, advisories, restrictions banning non-essential travel and quarantine and isolation orders. And even as the machinery of public health and safety ground ponderously into action, deficiencies in preparedness were glaring. Public inquiries - among them the Auditor-General of Canada's report on pandemic preparedness; the Independent Review Panel on the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN); and the report from the Ontario Long-Term Care COVID-19 Commission - have, or are, documenting serious deficiencies, including lapses in the risk assessment process, lack of integration of surveillance information, inadequate supplies of personal protective equipment, faulty logistics for amassing and distributing laboratory supplies, capacity shortages, problems with data quality and sharing and untested emergency plans. In the aftermath, two questions are uppermost: First, why was Canada so unprepared? Second, Auditor-General Karen Hogan stated, ""when the public service must, the public service can,"" referring to programs that ""were rolled out in record time."" Why were officials able to respond quickly when faced with a crisis yet unable to fix weaknesses that were known for decades? Predictably, Public Health Agency of Canada officials have said they will address identified shortcomings by incorporating ""learnings from the pandemic into its plans and test them as appropriate."" In response to the Auditor-General's report, Public Health Agency of Canada has promised to update its plans within two years of the end of the pandemic. Even setting aside the obvious problem that pandemics do not have clearly defined end dates, the two-year timeline is problematic. Essentially, it kicks this issue down the road to an interpandemic period when intense scrutiny has abated, creating the same conditions that left us ill-prepared for COVID-19. Canadians rightly expect better from the public officials charged with keeping them safe than a tardy and reactive approach to fast-moving biological threats. Given that reforms in the aftermath of the 2003 SARS crisis, including the creation of the Public Health Agency of Canada, were clearly inadequate, is it realistic to expect that applying the same old approaches will yield a different result next time? In April of this year, the health minister at the time, Patty Hajdu, asserted that a ""full investigation"" was warranted and required at an ""appropriate time."" The appropriate time is now. Canadians have a right to a full, fair, independent and public inquiry into the whole-of-government response to this pandemic and to the lessons and practical reforms such an inquiry will yield. The inquiry must identify specific inadequacies - and consider how elements within the public health and safety apparatus can work better together. This includes provisions, communications, supply lines, operations and execution - all in the context of Canada's provincially administered health care system and constitutional division of powers. Such an exercise is bound to reflect negatively, in some respects, on the current federal and provincial governments. That is the point of examining what we did wrong, in hopes of doing things better. But it is the government's duty to muster the courage to suffer short-term political pain in the interest of long-term national gain. Without a full, fair and public inquiry, painful though the process may be, Canada remains at risk of being blindsided by the next zoonotic threat. And that is a risk Canadians can ill afford.

"To deal with COVID-19 pandemic uncertainty, let’s stop repeating our mistakes",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-to-deal-with-pandemic-uncertainty-lets-stop-repeating-our-mistakes/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"Heading into year three of the pandemic, the situation is more uncertain than ever. But COVID-19 has taught us a lot about uncertainty – we should be applying those lessons, not despairing about Omicron",['André Picard'],2021-12-07 07:00:00,"As the world staggers unsteadily toward the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Canada braces warily for a fifth wave, the situation is as unstable as it has ever been. In late December, 2019, we were unsure what the emergence of a novel coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan would mean to the world. In December, 2021, we are almost as unsure what the emergence of a new coronavirus variant, Omicron, will mean to the pandemic trajectory. After more than 700 days of uncertainty, you would think we would be a lot better at dealing with uncertainty. One thing that would certainly help is learning from our mistakes and not repeating them, wave after wave. And yet, the same patterns are repeated over and over again. It begins with denial. Our Western arrogance deludes us into thinking that pathogens respect borders - or at least border police. The 2019 dismissal, ""that only matters in China,"" became the 2021 denial, ""that only matters in South Africa."" So what do we do? We shut down borders. That feels like action, but it has limited effectiveness. By the time border controls were brought in, the Wuhan strain of COVID-19 had already spread widely in Europe. Similarly, as we began slapping travel restrictions on South Africa and its neighbours, Omicron was already in Europe and on its way to North America. That doesn't mean there isn't a place for travel restrictions in a pandemic. But they have to be administered smartly, with universal vaccine passports and testing, not by singling out groups of people based on their passports. What sense does it make for Canada to shut out South Africans while allowing citizens of the United States (the hardest-hit country on Earth) to cross the border with minimal restrictions? One lesson COVID-19 should have taught us is that instead of building ever-higher walls, we should be reaching out to those in need - out of rational self-interest, if nothing else. The single biggest barrier to ending the pandemic - and, yes, it will end - is inequitable distribution of vaccines. But just as Western countries bought up and hoarded first doses of vaccines, they are now moving overly aggressively on booster shots, further delaying the administration of vaccines in the developing world. The news is not all grim, though: 7.8 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in just over a year; 3.3 billion people - roughly 43 per cent of the world's population - have had at least two doses. The vaccines are also working relatively well, with hospitalizations and deaths falling, except among the unvaccinated. Yet, we continue to pander to those who selfishly refuse to do their civic duty by refusing to get vaccinated. And we've done far too little to counter the disinformation that is fuelling vaccine hesitancy. Probably the most common and harmful mistake we have made repeatedly is lifting restrictions too quickly. Our impatience has allowed COVID-19 to surge anew, time and time again. Who can forget Alberta Premier Jason Kenney essentially declaring the pandemic to be over and then the province being hammered by COVID in the months that followed? In uncertain times, we make unequivocal statements and policies at our peril. No one should dare declare victory until long after the pandemic has passed. Uncertainty is difficult to deal with on a personal level. It causes a lot of anxiety. It's probably even more difficult to cope with on a policy level. We like rules to be clear. We want precise parameters and deadlines. But for the past two years, the rules have been ever-changing and in flux - and that has been made worse because our government apparatuses are not built to be nimble. Too often, governments are paralyzed by ideological and economic arguments that result in head-scratchingly bad public policies. What has served us well during the pandemic is pragmatism, a willingness to embrace the discomfort of not knowing what's coming next and being willing to adapt. There are few, if any, perfect responses to the challenges posed by COVID-19. But there are many good responses, and they will allow us to muddle through. The COVID-19 pandemic is complex because there are many interdependent and unpredictable elements, but many of the solutions are not complicated, and have been successfully implemented. We have to shift our mindset from treating COVID-19 as an acute problem and see it as a chronic one. What we need now is not despair, but realistic optimism - the knowledge that we will succeed eventually, even though it won't be easy. Keep your Opinions sharp and informed.

Opinion: Canada's muddled pandemic communications,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-canadas-muddled-pandemic-communications,nationalpost.com,A look back at the last several weeks provides ample evidence of why Canadians are bewildered,"['Vivek Goel', 'Peter Loewen', 'Janice Gross Stein', 'Special To National Post']",2021-05-09 00:00:00,"Photo by Blair Gable/Reuters One of the biggest challenges Canada has faced throughout this pandemic is that so many leaders and so many voices are involved in the official response. Politicians give regular press conferences. Public health officials do the same. Advisory committees of independent experts speak up and challenge not only governments, but other experts. Researchers, clinicians and journalists all have something to say. Our fuzzy federalism makes this that much harder, as it multiplies voices and points of authority. In order to get through this third wave, and stave off a potential fourth wave in the fall, this needs to change. . As the third wave built in Ontario, public health experts recommended a draconian shutdown and paid sick leave for essential workers. The premier closed the schools (after some local medical officers of health acted on their own), but also outdoor playgrounds. He empowered the police to engage in random checks of out-and-about citizens. Howls of outrage from angry public health experts followed. Police forces almost uniformly said they would do no such thing. Then the chair of the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), in the middle of a brutal third wave in Alberta and Ontario, told Canadians to wait for the mRNA vaccines if they were at low risk of catching COVID. Other public health experts piled on immediately and the prime minister asked Canadians to take any vaccine they could get as quickly as they could. No wonder people are confused. How do we reconcile the role of experts - who provide important advice to governments, yet often disagree amongst themselves in the face of rapidly evolving research - and the responsibility of elected officials to make decisions based on their advice? There are no easy answers here, but to successfully get through the third wave, and to stave off a fourth, the role of politicians and experts needs to be clarified. There is no trade-off between competent management of the pandemic and political success. The data are clear. At the start of the pandemic, provincial governments across Canada were buoyed by high approval ratings. Indeed, every provincial government had a score of +39 or greater, meaning that for every 100 people, 39 more people approved than disapproved of their provincial government's handling of the crisis. The second wave was the differentiator. Ontario, Quebec and the West fared relatively poorly, while Atlantic Canada maintained the highly effective Atlantic bubble. Since then, Atlantic Canada has largely been able to stay the course and has marshalled substantial public support in dealing with outbreaks. In contrast, governments in Alberta and Ontario failed to act swiftly as indicators clearly signalled a third wave was coming. Clearly, citizens noticed: provincial governments in Atlantic Canada still have a +40 approval rating for their handling of the pandemic, while in Ontario and Western Canada, it's at -2 and -3, respectively. There are a number of lessons we can learn from this about the appropriate role of politicians and experts. First, people are not good at intuitively understanding risk. Those who study decision-making have known this for a long time. When there is a one in 100,000 chance of a side effect from a vaccine, experts have to tell us that, but they should then put it in context: it's far lower than driving your car on the highway everyday and much less than catching COVID if you are living or working in an environment with even modest levels of community transmission. Experts need to explain the comparative risks to people using examples that are easy to understand. Talking about risk that way does not ignore the evidence or compromise the truth. On the contrary, putting risk in context helps people make better decisions. Likewise, political leaders have an obligation to listen carefully to the scientists and the public health experts. But it should come as no surprise that these two groups can disagree with each other and even amongst themselves in the face of new research. So the premiers and the prime minister should level with the public. When they're announcing a decision, they should tell us if they were the ones who ultimately made the call because their experts were divided. If the public health experts are all of one mind, the public should be informed of that, as well. And if the experts largely agree, but the politicians make a different decision, they should tell us why. After all, the buck stops with our elected leaders. They are the ones who are accountable.

OPINION: Women must be central to Canada’s pandemic recovery,https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-women-must-be-central-to-canadas-pandemic-recovery,torontosun.com,By Michelle Eaton and Dr. Wendy Cukier,['Special To Toronto Sun'],2020-07-16 00:00:00,"Photo by Stock / Getty Images The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on women. Most strikingly observed amongst women from disadvantaged populations, it is also taking a harsh toll on women entrepreneurs. Existing systemic inequalities pre-pandemic have been further exacerbated by recent shut-down measures, resulting in what some economists are calling a ""she-cession,"" as more women have lost their jobs and fewer women than men are re-gaining employment. What is clear is this: we will not achieve our full economic potential if support for women is not centred in our planning. Every day, women entrepreneurs actively contribute to the Canadian economy. Women lead 50% of all new businesses in Canada as well as partially or wholly own 47% of all small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME). Businesses led by women create more jobs and have a higher chance of survival even though they generally tend to be smaller than businesses led by men. Nearly four in 10 self-employed Canadians are women. Women-owned businesses tend to be smaller, with fewer employees, and are less likely to be incorporated. Unfortunately, most government support programs during the pandemic favour SMEs with employees. Many of the programs are designed for SME owners with payroll and although eligibility was recently expanded in the loan program to address this issue, many self-employed Canadians still may not meet the requirements. The thresholds for many of these programs do not accommodate women, leaving them no options but to find other means of supporting themselves, their workers, and their businesses. As for women workers, the realities of the pandemic are even harsher. Women are more likely to work in retail and service roles at the frontlines of COVID-19 support (from personal support workers to grocery clerks). Women also bear the brunt of unpaid work, including childcare, household duties, and elder care - all of which have become more challenging during the crisis. Adding to the responsibilities is the fact that although the pay gap between men and women has narrowed over the past 30 years, women are still paid less than men for doing the same work. These issues are intensified for women with lower incomes, as they often lack the options afforded to wealthier Canadians, such as housing large enough to provide for distancing and quarantine, work that can be done from home, access to financial resources to draw on during a crisis and to cover additional costs, access to private vehicles (versus public transportation), and access to technology, digital skills, and literacy needed to navigate the new reality. These challenges are particularly acute for Black, Indigenous and racialized women, women who live in rural communities, senior women, immigrant women, and women with disabilities - all of whom may be experiencing disruptions to their regular lines of care and support. As we look at the path to economic recovery, we must continue to improve the alignment between public policy and economic outcomes. Breaking down barriers women face during the pandemic will lead to new economic activity and growth: more women entrepreneurs mean more wealth generation, more women in the skilled trades mean more opportunities to build, and more women in decision-making roles mean more inclusive outcomes.

Opinion: COVID-19 vaccination for children should not further divide us,https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-covid-19-vaccination-for-children-should-not-further-divide-us,calgaryherald.com,"Families for Choice was formed by families, vaccinated and unvaccinated, united in our mission to safeguard the rights of families to choose whether and when…",['Calgary Herald'],2021-11-08 00:00:00,"Gavin Young/Postmedia Families for Choice was formed by families, vaccinated and unvaccinated, united in our mission to safeguard the rights of families to choose whether and when to vaccinate their children against COVID-19. We profoundly believe that each family's choice, however made, should not affect their children's ability to access services, attend school or participate in extracurricular activities or organized sports. As we've already seen with the 12- to 17-year-olds, vaccine mandates result in segregation, exclusion and stigmatization of unvaccinated children. They deny these children the opportunity to do many things they otherwise would: play for the community hockey team, be a part of a dance group, go to a Flames game, take swimming lessons at the local YMCA, attend the school ski field trip or go bowling with their friends. Equally devastating, these kids are being uninvited from birthday parties, excluded from sleepovers and made to drive in separate cars. Over the last few months, I've had heard heart-wrenching stories: a teenage girl being dropped from the dance studio she'd danced at all her life; a teenage boy not allowed to travel on the team bus to a hockey tournament; a 12-year-old boy prevented from continuing his passion for snowboarding at Calgary's local hill. The loss of connection and mental anguish, coupled with the lack of access to physical activity, is not, I truly believe, what many people in our society want or are willing to accept. Families For Choice exists to fight for the inclusion of all children regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. I am a Calgary mother who is double-vaccinated against COVID-19. My children attend a public elementary school. They have received all routine immunizations as well as extras for travel. Soon, when the COVID-19 vaccine is approved for five- to 11-year-olds, my husband and I, in consultation with our doctor, will be faced with the decision of whether to vaccinate them for this too. In my circle of family and friends, there are those who are eager to vaccinate their young children against COVID-19, and I understand and respect their decision. There are others who are not yet ready, and some who may never be ready, and I understand and respect their decision too. Herein lies the dilemma. As parents, we make decisions every day that impact our children's well-being. We make those decisions to the best of our ability, with the primary purpose of protecting our children. The distinction with parenting decisions regarding COVID-19 is that they have become a source of stress and judgment. Sadly, no matter what you choose, there will always be someone who disagrees with you, and isn't afraid to say so. As a society, we have been traumatized by the impacts of COVID-19. Whether we have lost someone close to us, or our income, or have been working tirelessly on the front lines, the collective trauma is adding up. We are all physically and mentally exhausted, yet many families across Alberta will also soon be faced with the question of whether to vaccinate their young children against COVID-19. Parents are rightfully asking, ""What are the long-term impacts of COVID-19 and the vaccine?"" ""Is there enough safety and efficacy data?"" ""Does the vaccine actually reduce infection and/or transmission?"" ""What happens if I'm not ready to vaccinate my kids?"" ""Are children going to be segregated according to vaccination status?"" I grew up in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, and know the impacts of segregated education first hand. This personal experience, along with a firm belief that there is no relationship more sacred than that between parent and child, is why I and a group of mothers co-founded Families For Choice. We are a grassroots movement that has grown to almost 4,000 members in two weeks. Now more than ever, we need to maintain the ability to listen to each other with empathy. We cannot let COVID-19 vaccinations for the youngest in society, the ones who need us most, become yet another source of division. Instead, we have an opportunity to focus on what unites us as parents and caregivers: protecting our children, however that looks to us as individual families. It's time to stand together for the children. They deserve it. Cathryn Carruthers is a co-founder of Families For Choice.

"Is the case for vaccine mandates like the case for seatbelt laws? No, it’s much, much stronger",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-is-the-case-for-vaccine-mandates-like-the-case-for-seatbelt-laws-no/,www.theglobeandmail.com,Many people on social media – as well as prominent Canadians like Gwyn Morgan – are missing the obvious math that shows that vaccination is highly effective in preventing illness and death from COVID-19,['Andrew Coyne'],2021-12-10 09:00:00,"Did you know that half the people killed in traffic accidents in any given year were wearing their seatbelts at the time? I've been doing my own research, and it's true. The obvious conclusion from this shocking statistic: seatbelts don't save lives. Why, you're just as likely to be killed with your seatbelt on as without! Obvious, and obviously wrong. It would be true, if the victims were as likely to be wearing seatbelts as not. But in fact more than 90 per cent of all passenger-vehicle occupants are seatbelt-wearers; of those involved in accidents, upward of 80 per cent. If seatbelt-wearers outnumber non-wearers by four to one, but account for roughly the same number of deaths, it suggests seatbelt-wearers are about one-fourth as likely to die in an accident as non-wearers. That shocking statistic turns out to be not so shocking as all that. This little tutorial in basic mathematics is for the benefit of the apparently growing numbers of vaccine opponents, or at least opponents of vaccine mandates (though in truth there is a high degree of overlap between the two). These include some of our most prominent citizens, which only goes to show that some of our most prominent citizens are incapable of basic maths. You see them swapping anecdotes on social media: a headline here, an excerpt from a study there. Sometimes the story is about the seemingly large percentage - 30 per cent! Forty per cent! Even 50 per cent! - of some group or other of COVID victims who had been vaccinated. No kidding? Recall our little tutorial. If 90 per cent of the adult public have been fully vaccinated, then even if the vaccinated account for half of those infected it still means the unvaccinated are nine times as likely to be infected as the vaccinated. To deal with COVID-19 pandemic uncertainty, let's stop repeating our mistakes The anti-vaccine rants from Doug Ford's daughter are now a matter of public interest Or look! Some countries that have high vaccination rates still have high numbers of cases! Yes, that's true. But all sorts of things could account for that: Vaccine rates are only one of many predictors of infection rates. So far as the two are related, moreover, the direction of causality is unclear. It's not surprising to find some countries with high infection rates also have high vaccination rates - the point of getting people vaccinated, after all, is to bring the infection rates down. Conversely, some countries that had very low infection rates through the first year of the pandemic have also been slow to roll out vaccination campaigns: there just wasn't the same sense of urgency. Finally, some countries with very high early vaccination rates, such as Israel and the United States, let down their guard too quickly, relaxing the restrictions that had been preventing the disease from spreading and allowing it to rebound - mostly among the unvaccinated. Sometimes it is enough for opponents that any vaccinated person could have caught the disease. Here's Gwyn Morgan, for example - former president of EnCana Corp., member of the Order of Canada etc., etc. - in the C2C Journal, citing ""increasing reports that fully vaccinated persons are getting and transmitting the virus"" as ""demolishing the very foundation"" of those ""divisive and draconian"" vaccine mandates. The evidence? Ten players on the Ottawa Senators tested positive. A COVID outbreak on a Canadian Forces base. Not to mention ""Canadian rock legend Bryan Adams!"" All were vaccinated. All got infected. But no vaccine has ever been 100 per cent effective, and no one has ever claimed they were. They don't need to be. Past a certain point, enough people have enough immunity that the virus cannot find enough new hosts to replicate itself. Immunity, it is true, can come from previous infection as well as vaccination. But infection carries risks, not only of serious disease and death, but of providing the virus fresh opportunities to mutate. By contrast, what are the risks of vaccination? They are not zero - again, no one ever said they were. But they are negligible. The Public Health Agency of Canada, like other public-health agencies, has been keeping track of all ""adverse events"" following vaccinations against COVID. These are, note, following vaccination - they are not necessarily because of it. But even if they were, the numbers are vanishingly small. As of Nov. 26, the latest date for which figures are available, they totalled 27,747 - out of about 60 million doses administered. Of these, just 6,443 were classified as ""serious."" That's roughly 1 in 9,300. Even if we attributed every one of those to the vaccine, we'd have to compare the result with the risk of ""adverse events"" from the disease. The death rate from COVID, for example, relative to population, is nearly 200 times as high as that following vaccination. To have reservations about a new vaccine in advance of its administration is understandable. But over the past year more than eight billion doses have been given worldwide: the largest trial in the history of humanity. If there was some hidden danger lurking within, it would have shown itself by now. All vaccines have side effects, but there has never been a vaccine whose side effects showed up more than two months after administration. The statistical evidence could not be clearer: Vaccines save lives. In Ontario, for example (the figures are representative of other jurisdictions), an unvaccinated person is currently 4.5 times more likely to be infected than a vaccinated person; 14 times more likely to be hospitalized; and 30 times more likely to be put in intensive care. It turns out vaccines are even more of a lifesaver than seatbelts. But here's the thing. A crankish libertarian - I count myself as one - might understand that seatbelts save lives, and still object to being required to wear one, on personal freedom grounds. That's perhaps tenable when it comes to seatbelt laws, since the only life in peril from not wearing one is your own. But vaccines not only make it less likely that you will be infected, suffer or die: They also make it less likely that you will infect others, to suffer and die - and infect still more people - in their turn. (And yes, despite what you might have heard, the evidence is also clear that vaccines reduce transmission rates.) This is hardly a theoretical concern, in the midst of a pandemic that has already claimed nearly 30,000 Canadian lives. So if anything the case for vaccine mandates is even stronger than it is for seatbelt laws. The cost to personal freedom - a jab in the arm - is slight. The risk of adverse side-effects is negligible. The savings in human lives is provably enormous. How on earth could so many otherwise sensible people have persuaded themselves otherwise?

Opinion: Vaccine mandates help anti-vaxxers get the shot while saving face,https://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-vaccine-mandates-help-anti-vaxxers-get-the-shot-while-saving-face,edmontonjournal.com,"As we head into our second pandemic fall in Alberta, there’s a glimmer of hope that this might be the last one.

Seventy-seven per cent of eligible Albertans are fully vaccinated. This still leaves close to a quarter who are not fully vaccinated, as well as 100 per cent of Albertans under the age of 12, but there's hope that vaccines for the under-12s will become available by the end of the year. The real problem is the adults who could get vaccinated but have not. Without more of them on board, we won't get long-term relief from COVID. A small minority - perhaps a few thousand - have medical conditions which preclude the COVID vaccines or well-established religious beliefs opposed to vaccination. Another small group may face genuine barriers of time, travel, or language to getting their shots. But that leaves most of the unvaccinated, who could get shots but are choosing not to. Vaccinations got a big bump when the vaccine passport was announced, but have fallen back down to pre-passport levels. Fortunately, we have the means to bring those levels up. There is no magic bullet for vaccine resistance. But the next best thing is vaccine mandates. I've come to this conclusion as a sociologist from observing what's happening in places which are doing much better than Alberta in controlling the pandemic, including the Maritimes and the northern jurisdictions in Canada. It's clear that mandates work - and not always for the reasons that you might expect. Vaccine mandates for employment have been extraordinarily successful in persuading holdouts to be vaccinated, according to American sociologist Zeynep Tufecki. In polls, unvaccinated workers say they'll quit rather than get their shots, but when it comes right down to it, the vast majority don't quit, they follow through and keep on working. Of the 67,000 people working for United Airlines, for instance, despite complaints about the company's vaccination mandate, only 232 people refused to get vaccinated. In North Carolina, out of more than 10,000 health-care workers subject to a statewide mandate, only 16 were terminated because they wouldn't get the shot. It's clear that even people who say they would never get vaccinated will do so if vaccination is a condition of employment, or of travel or of accessing public spaces. The real power of vaccine mandates, however, is not just that they provide an incentive to get the shot. Their power is that they enable even those people who've been vocally opposed to vaccination a face-saving way to get their shots - without having to admit that their anti-vax views might have been wrong, and without having to contradict the anti-vax or vaccine-hesitant opinions which might be popular in their personal networks. ""I have to get the shots because the company says so"" is much easier to acknowledge than ""I've changed my mind on vaccination and I realize that what I thought and said earlier was wrong."" Saving face is enormously important in human decision-making - the fear of losing face or looking dumb can prevent people from doing things that they might otherwise do, and the opportunity to save face can provide a way to get those things done. By bringing in vaccine mandates, governments effectively take the hot potato of vaccination out of people's hands and put it in the hands of the employer or the school or the province. People who may be overtly opposed to vaccination but secretly willing to get immunized can still complain or blame the government or the boss or the school - and they can also get their shots. And while they may never become converts to the idea of mass vaccination, the more people who get their shots, the safer we are as a province. It's important to note that vaccine mandates aren't compulsory vaccination, which is not and never will be practised anywhere in Canada. Vaccine mandates create consequences for the choice to get or not get the shots. Vaccination is like getting a drivers' licence - anyone is free to not hold a driver's licence, but the consequence is that you can't legally drive. Given that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks, it's reasonable to attach consequences to not getting the shot. So far, the provincial government has opted for hearts-and-minds, personal-responsibility pleas to people to get their shots. That strategy probably worked for the first 60-65 per cent of eligible people. But to get our vaccination rates up to the point where this might be the last COVID fall, we need a different strategy. Mandates can get us there. Amy Kaler is a professor in the department of sociology at the University of Alberta.

We want them to learn, to socialize with their friends, to play in bands or on the basketball court. But schools must first be safe for students, teachers, and staff. , practise public health measures With this in mind, the Saskatchewan Medical Association (SMA) and the Saskatchewan College of Family Physicians (SCFP) urge school divisions to enact measures that will mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in their schools. The provincial government has granted school divisions the authority to enact whatever measures they deem necessary. In the absence of provincewide leadership to safeguard our schools, the SMA and the SCFP implore school division leaders to consider the following: - Mandate the wearing of masks in all indoor spaces, including in classrooms and common areas. Revisit this mandate only when case numbers improve in their communities. - Mandate full vaccination of everyone 12 and over, including students and staff, and parents or guardians of school-aged children, as recommended by the Saskatchewan Teachers' Federation. - Facilitate the establishment of mobile vaccination clinics in schools. - Require all sick children and adults to stay home and get tested. - Report positive cases to parents, or anyone who needs to know, as soon as possible, and have close contacts self-isolate. - Make sanitizing dispensers widely available, and continue to practise handwashing and sanitization. - Maintain social distancing when possible, until case numbers subside. - Clean and test HVAC systems regularly to ensure they are functioning properly. As physicians and as parents, we are gravely concerned as children return to school in less than two weeks at a time when COVID-19 case numbers are on an upward trajectory, spurred by the highly contagious Delta variant. Late last week, Saskatchewan had its highest number of active cases in two months, at more than 1,000. The seven-day average now tops 100 - it was 26 on July 16. Saskatchewan also has one of the highest rates of active cases per 100,000 people and new cases per 100,000. Meanwhile, Saskatchewan trails all provinces in vaccinations of people aged 12 and older who have received at least one dose, and has among the lowest rates of fully vaccinated people 12 and older. This is especially concerning as we now have a pandemic of the unvaccinated, spurred by the highly contagious Delta variant, yet children under 12 cannot yet receive their shots. As the largest unvaccinated group, children under 12 are most at risk of contracting the Delta variant. In July, 18 per cent of COVID-19 cases in Saskatchewan occurred in children under age 12. Preventable deaths and disability are not acceptable. Pfizer and Moderna are conducting trials for the 5-11 age group, but the results may not be known until the end of the year. However, a return to school is imminent and we don't have time to wait for the studies. As children return to school soon - which we want them to do - physicians urge school divisions to implement public health measures for the benefit their students, teachers, school staff and support workers, and their parents. Protecting each other just makes sense. The safety of our children is our paramount concern. And put quite simply, isn't that just the Saskatchewan way? Dr. Eben Strydom, a Melfort family physician, is president of the Saskatchewan Medical Association; Dr. Myles Deutscher is president of the Saskatchewan College of Family Physicians.

Business objects to de Blasio’s vaccine mandate,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-business-objects-to-de-blasios-vaccine-mandate/,www.theglobeandmail.com,New York Mayor Bill de Blasio imposed a new mandate forcing all private businesses in the city to have their workers vaccinated against COVID-19 by Dec. 27,['Gus Carlson'],2021-12-10 16:13:55,"For a fellow with higher political aspirations, outgoing New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has a peculiar but perhaps predictable way of treating a constituency as influential as the city's business community. But for the notoriously business-unfriendly Mr. de Blasio, his research - or his gut - must be telling him that, as he eyes a run for the governor's office, he can do without them. How else to explain his stunning move this week to impose a new mandate forcing all private businesses in the city to have their workers vaccinated against COVID-19 by Dec. 27, three days before he leaves office? The new rule, affecting 184,000 businesses in America's largest city, also eliminates the regular testing option for workers who refuse vaccination. Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat who failed in a U.S. presidential bid in 2020, called the move a ""pre-emptive strike"" against a triple threat of COVID-19-related factors: holiday gatherings, colder weather and the potential impact of the Omicron variant. Mr. de Blasio has been no stranger to criticism for anti-business policies during his eight years as mayor, but this latest edict, which blindsided many business leaders, is particularly jarring to a city business community struggling to recover from the pandemic. It also bucks a national trend that has seen the Biden administration's federal vaccine mandates for businesses blocked in several states, including a ruling on Tuesday barring mandatory vaccination for private government contractors. The de Blasio mandate, details of which won't be released until next week, has irked businesses large and small, not only because of its potential to further slow an economic recovery but because it is almost impossible to implement on such a tight deadline. And, many say, he did not consult business leaders as he often does about such important decisions. ""It's pure politics,"" Kathryn Wylde, president and chief executive officer of the Partnership for New York, a group of chief executives, said in media interviews, adding that the mandate will prevent people's return to work and limit consumer traffic. Business media, too, called out the mayor. A Wall Street Journal editorial, ""Bill de Blasio's Parting Insult,"" said the mandate was ""coercive and counterproductive."" Perhaps the most critical voice is that of Eric Adams, who will inherit the mandate when he succeeds Mr. de Blasio as mayor on Jan. 1. In a statement, Mr. Adams's office was non-committal, saying he would evaluate the mandate and other strategies ""and make determinations based on science, efficacy and the advice of health professionals."" Mr. de Blasio's mandate points to the deep political divide in the U.S. around the management of the pandemic. More than two dozen states have filed legal challenges to the Biden administration's ""vax-or-test"" mandates for businesses. Over the past month, federal courts have blocked vaccination mandates for 10 million U.S. health care workers and similar federal mandates in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Utah. Florida has been among the most aggressive states in pushing back. Last month Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, signed a law prohibiting vaccine mandates for employees of private companies and imposing stiff fines of as much as US$50,000 per employee for companies that violate the law. Most confusing to many Americans is that leaders on both sides of the aisle - Mr. de Blasio, Mr. Adams and Mr. DeSantis included - claim science as a guiding principle yet have very different approaches to its application. It's unclear who is right, as the numbers of COVID-19 cases rise and fall regularly in red and blue states regardless of the approach. What is clear is that the management of COVID-19 is neither purely political nor purely science - it is perhaps best described as ""political science."" As for Mr. de Blasio and his latest gambit, his track record suggests that, despite his weak showing on the national stage, he knows New Yorkers. Clearly the numbers and whispers informing his decision to run for governor indicate the mandate is a move in the right direction, despite any criticism it generates. Or perhaps he is simply channelling his inner P.T. Barnum, the circus impresario who said famously to a blackmailing writer: ""Say anything you like about me but spell my name right.""

Opinion: It's time to learn to live with COVID,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-its-time-to-learn-to-live-with-covid,nationalpost.com,The benefits of elimination attempts have greatly diminished with rising vaccination rates and more effective treatment strategies for COVID-19,"['Alanna Golden', 'Jennifer Grant', 'Jocelyn Srigley', 'Shawn Whatley', 'Special To National Post']",2021-08-18 00:00:00,"Photo by Gavin Young/Postmedia The COVID-19 pandemic has often been described as unprecedented, even though, throughout history, we have repeatedly witnessed the spread of pandemic diseases - pathogens we still live with to this day. Thanks to improved sanitation and cleanliness, early pandemics such as typhoid fever, bubonic plague and cholera are now rare in most parts of the world. On the other hand, relatives of more recent pandemic influenza viruses - such as the Spanish flu of 1918, the Asian flu of 1957, the Hong Kong flu of 1968 and, most recently, the swine flu of 2009 - still exist and circulate each fall and winter. Only one human pandemic disease, smallpox, has ever been eradicated. Respiratory viruses like SARS‑CoV‑2 are likely impossible to eradicate because they mutate frequently to evade the immune system, they can reside in animal reservoirs and they are widely distributed around the world. Early on in the pandemic, some countries, such as Australia, tried to implement ""COVID-zero"" policies, with the aim of keeping out all cases using mandatory hotel quarantines and travel bans. By July 2020, Australia's deputy chief medical officer declared that eliminating COVID-19 was a ""false hope."" Today, half of Australia's population is back in lockdown as many parts of the world plow ahead with reopening. Indeed, recent experience with COVID-19 confirms what we know to be true of other viral respiratory pandemics: they settle into the human population with smaller waves over time, eventually causing milder seasonal respiratory illness. The greatest accomplishment of this pandemic has been the development of new vaccines in record time. The fastest any vaccine had previously been developed was four years. In early December 2020, a vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech became the first fully tested immunization to be approved for emergency use. The COVID-19 vaccination program in Canada began in mid-December 2020, with a campaign targeting long-term care (LTC) and retirement home residents and health-care workers. Vaccination of the elderly was the initial priority, given the high rates of serious illness and death in that population. To date, there have been 25,017 deaths reported in those ages 60 and older in Canada, accounting for 93.9 per cent of COVID-19 related deaths. Fortunately, there has been a high vaccine uptake in those ages 60 and older, with over 90 per cent having received at least one dose and nearly 85 per cent fully vaccinated. This has resulted in a significant decline in severe illness and death among LTC residents since early February, despite high levels of community transmission in the spring. Recent COVID-19 outbreaks occurring in these facilities have resulted in fewer infections and hospitalizations, owing to effective vaccines and natural immunity from earlier infections. The COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in Canada have been shown to be successful in large clinical trails and this has been supported by real-world data. While vaccines are highly effective in preventing hospital admission, even against the Delta variant, they are less effective at stopping transmission. When disease elimination is likely impossible, the goal of vaccination becomes a reduction of illness severity. Since COVID-19 vaccines effectively reduce disease severity and death, we can move beyond case counting and instead focus on measures of severe illness such as hospitalizations and death. A natural decoupling of cases from hospitalizations has occurred in highly vaccinated populations such as the United Kingdom, Israel and the United States. With high vaccine coverage among populations at greatest risk of severe disease, continuing to follow case numbers becomes irrelevant over time. This has become the case in Canada. Rather than continuing to focus on testing, our resources should be directed toward efforts that focus on vaccinating those at increased risk such as workers in high-risk settings (hospitals, jails, shelters), people with underlying diseases, the elderly and those who are obese. To date, over 80 per cent of eligible Canadians have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and over 70 per cent are fully vaccinated. In Canada, most COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths are now among the unvaccinated. Thus, a more balanced strategy is required to allow us to live with this virus. The high costs of repeated elimination attempts and prolonged societal lockdowns have impacted the economy, livelihoods, businesses and the broader health and well-being of our society. Vulnerable populations, including racialized groups, have faced challenges such as housing and food insecurity and mental health concerns. Children and youth have also been significantly impacted. The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto has noted an increase in demand for mental health services, including eating disorder admissions, psychiatry admissions and mental health crisis visits. . Accepting life with COVID-19 will require a shift in thinking. Health is about more than just the coronavirus, and we need to begin to take a broader view of our overall health and well-being. We have largely overlooked causes of preventable death during the pandemic, including overdoses, which have increased dramatically. Modelling has suggested that missed screening and the resulting delays in cancer diagnoses could result in an additional 8,094 cancer deaths in Quebec alone between 2020 and 2025. If we accept COVID-19 as an endemic virus, we should not be surprised with small periodic and seasonal rises in hospital admissions and even occasional deaths. It is a usual occurrence for our hospitals to become busy with seasonal respiratory viruses in the fall and winter. Our knee-jerk reaction should no longer be to close large sectors of society, including schools, now that at-risk adults have been vaccinated, or have access to vaccines. We are no longer in an acute crisis thanks to vaccines, natural immunity from earlier infections and improved treatments. We need to recognize that not all measures used to control the spread of COVID-19 earlier in the pandemic are necessary at this time. Good hand hygiene and staying home when sick are practices that should be here to stay. The use of COVID-19 testing where there is a direct impact on patient care, such as in hospital settings, will continue to be important, as will sentinel testing (testing random samples of a population), which has been done for decades. Otherwise, we need to remember that mitigation measures such as masking and social distancing have not been routinely used to control common seasonal respiratory illnesses. Given what we have achieved with vaccination rates in Canada and the corresponding decrease in hospitalizations and deaths, the risk of overwhelming the health-care system has been reduced and public health management can shift to an endemic approach. According to the World Health Organization, ""health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being."" It is time to prioritize the overall health and well-being of our country.

Children’s voices deserve to be heard during COVID-19. Let’s not let them be forgotten,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-childrens-voices-deserve-to-be-heard-during-covid-19-lets-not-let-them/,www.theglobeandmail.com,Children’s perspectives and experiences during the pandemic continue to be overlooked,"['Sydney Campbell', 'Franco Carnevale']",2021-11-23 16:01:38,"Sydney Campbell is a PhD candidate in the Institute of Health Policy, Management & Evaluation at the University of Toronto. She works as a research assistant with the VOICE Childhood Ethics program at McGill University in Montreal. Franco Carnevale, RN, PhD (Psych), PhD (Phil) is a nurse, psychologist and child and youth services ethicist. He leads the VOICE Childhood Ethics program. With Health Canada recently approving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for those aged 5 to 11, it is important to pause and draw attention to one undeniable truth in the pandemic: children remain invisible. It may be true that the impact of COVID-19 on young people has recently been at the centre of the public discourse stage, particularly because getting ""back to normal"" requires us to consider and protect this significant population. However, most dialogue has focused on COVID-19 vaccine approval processes for children, the opinions and concerns of parents, and plans for vaccine rollout. Young people themselves remain in the background of this same stage. While researchers continue to engage with various stakeholders to reach and understand children and their families, in many cases young people continue to be overlooked. Emerging evidence continues to indicate that young people in Canada are really not doing all right during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health concerns are growing. Transmission risks are gaining momentum, along with other physical health concerns. Early education pathways, though slowly returning to normal, have been disrupted in crucial ways. Engaging in community organizations, while vital for support and socialization, has been challenging. Young people also bear those burdens within their families and other social circles. And unlike the rest of the population, many young people have had to wait a significant period for a vaccine. A decision driven by safety, yes, but one that further amplifies lingering fears and continuing harms. More than that, young people remain on the periphery of the dominant dialogues related to the pandemic. In many ways, the ones who are best equipped to explain these nuanced experiences are the young people themselves. The lack of engagement with children in media stories, especially those that are thought to be child-focused or related to children, have implicitly positioned children as an afterthought. When we fail to ask young people what they're thinking about, feeling, or hoping for, we end up speaking for them. As a result, this has led to misunderstanding the depth of these impacts and the spaces within the child's life that these harms reach. However, when given the chance to share in meaningful ways, young people's voices can fill voids, relieve gaps, and open new outlets for exploration and strategizing. In advances made by childhood ethics and childhood studies scholars, we can begin to challenge the dominant views that treat young people as secondary citizens. We are encouraged to see children as individuals with rights, interests, ideas, capacities and knowledge of what is right/wrong or good/bad. We can see a young person, in the here and now, as important. And we can recognize that children do not care solely about themselves. In one paper, young people revealed that they wish to be considered as valuable and active contributors in COVID-recovery-plan development for their communities. In our own continuing work at VOICE Childhood Ethics, we have heard young people speak about the unanswered challenges they're facing and their hopes for reciprocity in pandemic responses, especially since they have given up many of their interests and borne significant harms for the sake of others. Our team has also seen concern for others mentioned repeatedly in our research with and about children. They worry about other people and, in the pandemic particularly, they can make decisions about what to do based on concerns about transmission to their family. What comes next, then? We must use this pause to reflect on how we view and make assumptions about young people. Media outlets, but also members of society, have a responsibility to challenge and reshape the dominant rhetoric. Young people matter. We must do what we can to enable children to be heard, in ways they want to be heard. This may involve supporting organizations that are actively bringing young people and decision makers together to encourage participation, or by making more space for children to have their voices heard in a variety of sectors. Ideally this type of engagement would occur before major decisions are made, or immediately following urgent deliberations. We must treat young people as experts on matters that affect them - because that's exactly what they are. And we must ensure that children do not become forgotten, trapped behind the closed curtain, but rather that they're positioned as narrators of their own experiences and aspirations.

Opinion: Canada must prepare its hospitals for COVID-19. And do it quickly,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-canada-must-prepare-its-hospitals-for-covid-19-and-do-it-quickly,nationalpost.com,A national task force is needed to strategize how to make room in our already overcrowded health-care centres,"['Dr. P.G. Forest', 'Dr. Jason Sutherland', 'National Post']",2020-03-04 00:00:00,"Photo by David Ryder/Reuters By Dr. P.G. Forest and Dr. Jason Sutherland If COVID-19 breaks out in Canada, hospitals will have to move quickly to make thousands of beds available to people affected by the virus. Hospitals will be able to accommodate those made critically ill by COVID-19 only by removing many patients to the community and sharing capacity between hospitals at local, regional and even possibly, at national levels. The World Health Organization says that countries should be prepared for a global pandemic, meaning a worldwide spread of the virus. With already over 80,000 cases and an estimated case fatality rate of over 2.0 per cent, the impact on health, wellness and the economy is significant in countries with important clusters of cases and those that have latent cases. China, as the epicentre of this new pathogen, has been hit particularly hard. Conservative statistics indicate that between 11 and 18 per cent of people known to have contracted the virus have developed serious or critical medical conditions. With over 77,000 cases, this means China is contending with well over 8,000 unanticipated hospitalizations for the treatment of illnesses due to COVID-19. Given the expected burden to the health systems, there is little wonder why health officials built a hospital with 1,000 beds in seven days. The World Health Organization says that countries should be prepared for a global pandemic If an outbreak occurs in a metropolitan area, given the virus's transmission patterns coupled with few safeguards to limit the virus's spread, tens or hundreds of thousands of cases may be presumed to require immediate medical attention as well as safe monitoring. An outbreak in Ottawa, for example, with points of egress in all directions, including into neighbouring Quebec, may generate as many as 10,000 cases among the city's residents in the first two months. Based on what is known so far, between 12 per cent and 18 per cent of cases might require hospitalization, if not intensive care, for periods from 10 days to two weeks, potentially more at the beginning of the outbreak as health-care workers learn and deploy safe protocols. The Canadian Institute for Health Information reported that, in the spring of 2018, there was capacity of just over 73,000 hospital beds in Canada, noting that statistics are not available for Quebec. Almost all of these beds are already occupied and the speed of response needed for a new epidemic could overwhelm even best-managed hospitals. The federal government has little sway to generate capacity in province's hospitals even in national emergencies. So, an epidemic will focus on provinces' and decentralized regions' responses to the outbreak. Unlike China, building a hospital - or more than one - within a week may be beyond a province's ability to treat affected Canadians needing urgent care. Photo by Arlen Redekop/Postmedia Provinces have many hospitals beds currently occupied by patients who are ready to leave but cannot, possibly due to having nowhere to go because of symptoms of advanced disorders or absence of able caregiver in the home. A chronic problem across all provinces, Health Quality Ontario reports that over 15 per cent of Ontario's hospital's beds are filled with patients ""ready to go home."" The best option to make space for people with severe symptomology of COVID-19 is to move out patients whom may not need the intensity of care provided in hospitals. Given what we can safely anticipate will be a huge stress on the capacity of our health workers and hospitals, it is preferable that patients are discharged to home. For others not yet ready to return home, long-term care beds will need to be rapidly found. This presents challenges for most provinces, with wait lists for long-term care beds a common occurrence. For others, hospital beds will need to be found among other hospitals. Co-ordination between hospitals at this speed will be a barrier, as the scale of moving hundreds of patients between hospitals, and away from the epicentre, will be fast. These complex and expensive moves alone may not open a sufficient number of beds. Then, provinces will need to move patients to hospitals in other provinces, a level of co-ordination that provinces have never experienced. The best option is to move out patients whom may not need the intensity of care provided in hospitals Provinces' silo-based health-care delivery systems would need to behave in ways they haven't before in order to avoid premature death and suffering among people affected by a COVID-19 outbreak. Last week, the federal minister of health, Patty Hajdu, reassured Canadians she has a plan. But her government, more than any other, knows that a plan is worth nothing if there is no one to guide or to direct, and the resources to execute. This rapid reallocation of hospital capacity and expertise is not an easy task. Today, we already have crowded emergency departments around the country and hospital beds occupied by patients whom are better served in other settings. A national task force of health-services experts under the leadership of the Public Health Agency of Canada should be quickly established whose objective is to prepare and give advice and support to local, regional and provincial authorities to make room in hospitals. Moving patients or imagining how to swap hospital beds between jurisdictions cannot be done under pressure, when decision-makers are looking for equipment, keeping their professionals safe and minimizing the impact of the virus. The federal government should also commit to compensating provinces for health-care costs in advance of the hospital bed crisis to avoid dithering and improvisation. Canadian epidemiologist Bruce Aylward, back from leading the World Health Organization mission to study the COVID-19 outbreak in China, said it well: ""Are we ready? No! We'll never be ready. But we have to be as ready as possible."" Dr. P.G. Forest is with the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary.

Time to step up once again and get your booster shot,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2021/12/09/time-to-step-up-once-again-and-get-your-booster-shot.html,www.thestar.com,"‘Now boosters are starting to look essential, as the potential danger from Omicron looms larger by the day.’",['Star Editorial Board'],2021-12-09 00:00:00,"It's time for Ontarians, at least those 50 and older, to roll up their sleeves once again. Starting on Monday, the province is making so-called booster shots - third doses of a COVID vaccine - available for anyone over that age. And as the warning bells start ringing louder about the next stage of this wretched pandemic, there's more reason than ever to get the shot. Boosters were a good idea, according to the experts, even before the Omicron variant of the coronavirus emerged as the latest threat. There was enough evidence of waning protection about six months after two doses of vaccine to prompt a recommendation that older people get a third shot. Now boosters are starting to look essential, as the potential danger from Omicron looms larger by the day. The latest data from vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and BioNTech, made public on Wednesday, suggests that a third dose provides a high level of protection against Omicron. The companies are carefully calling their evidence on this point ""preliminary."" But we've learned enough after 21 months of COVID to know that if we wait for definitive results it will almost certainly be too late. Omicron is spreading rapidly in South Africa, where it was first detected, and in parts of Europe. It may only be a matter of time, and not much time at that, before it displaces the Delta variant as the dominant strain in Canada. So it's up to all of us to do what we can now - not in weeks or months - to protect ourselves and those around us. For those who have already had their first two doses of COVID vaccine, that means signing up at the first opportunity for a booster. Governments haven't been pushing boosters very hard. Their emphasis is still on getting the unvaxxed and the partially vaxxed among us to step up and get their first two doses. And, more recently, on persuading parents to get their children aged 5 to 11 vaccinated, now that they're eligible as well. In light of the Omicron threat, that's going to have to change quickly. Unless there's persuasive evidence to the contrary, health authorities are going to have to put a lot more emphasis on making sure people get those boosters. At the same time, they should surely revisit the schedule for who is eligible, and when. The federal National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) now ""strongly recommends"" that people 50 and over get a third dose at least 168 days after their second shot. But its recommendation for younger people is only ""discretionary,"" depending on a variety of risk factors. Is that enough? Does it send an urgent enough message in favour of booster shots, with Omicron on the way? Priorities must be sorted out, but why not open up eligibility quicker to more people? Why not be safer, not sorrier, if there truly is reason to believe that third doses provide a high degree of protection against the new variant? At the same time, efforts to vaccinate as many kids, those aged 5 to 11, as possible, must continue. There's worrisome evidence that, as with first and second shots for adults, success there is highly variable. In Toronto at least, some neighbourhoods already have nearly 70 per cent vaccinated with a first doses; others (poorer ones) ""are sputtering along in the single digits,"" according to reporting in The Local. On both fronts - boosters for adults and first doses for kids - there needs to be much more urgency. If we've learned anything in the past 21 months, that's it."

Brooks']",2020-06-24 00:00:00,"Photo by David Bloom / Postmedia The outbreak of COVID-19 has had an enormous impact on how health information is communicated, how individuals seek health information and services, and how these services are delivered. There has been a dramatic reduction in the number of children and families seeking health care, as well as delays in seeking health care. Visiting the emergency department (ED) can be scary and overwhelming, especially when you don't know what to expect and you're trying to care for your sick child. It's become even more challenging for families because of changes to hospital policies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It's important for families to understand essential health information and know when to use health services. This helps parents and families make informed decisions so that their children receive the care they need, when they need it. Bring your child to the emergency department if they have any of the following symptoms: Difficulty breathing; Pauses in their breathing, or has an irregular breathing pattern, or starts grunting to breathe; Blue lips or skin, or looks very pale, mottled and feels abnormally cold to touch; Seizure; Anaphylactic reaction; Excessive vomiting, especially if there is blood in the vomit; Diarrhea and vomiting, and have not peed for several hours or have no tears; High fever, appear very sleepy, and have not improved with acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil); Extremely distressed, confused, and appear very sleepy or unresponsive; Develop a rash that does not go away with pressure; Under three months of age and have a fever greater than 38C (100.4F) If you are unsure whether or not your child needs to go to the ED, call Health Link by dialing 811 for advice from a registered nurse. They will ask questions, assess symptoms and determine the best care for your child. Some hospital procedures have changed during the pandemic. If you're directed to take your child to the ED, here are some examples of what to expect: Expect additional screening processes . This may include asking about your child's symptoms, if you or your child have travelled in the past 14 days, and if you or your child have had close contact with a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19. In some EDs, patient-waiting areas may be separated based upon additional screening. The ED may look different. There may only be one entrance that is open. Most hospitals only allow one parent or caregiver to come in with a sick child. Hospital staff will also look different. They will be wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gowns, masks, eye shields, and gloves. This may be scary for your child. You and your child may also be asked to wear masks. With this pandemic likely to last for a while, we need to make sure people are getting timely care for what they need. If your child is experiencing symptoms that on any other day would require a trip to the ED, take them to the ED. Your emergency department is safe - if you need to go, you should.

In Canada, it has been heart-warming to see the responses of people who are working together to protect the elderly and other vulnerable members of our communities. The situation has also highlighted that Canadians still place a lot of faith in our government and institutions, and that we are willing to act quickly and collectively to ensure that our health-care system does not become overwhelmed. However, as borders shut down, provinces declare states of emergency and businesses close, attention has rightly turned to the impact this will have on the economy. Focusing on the economy is important, as the broad social consensus previously outlined is at risk of fracturing if the government does not develop a comprehensive plan to address the real and growing concerns of Canadians who are worried about putting food on the table and paying their bills. Policy options abound, such as low- or zero-interest business loans, tax payment deferrals, payroll tax holidays, expanded access to employment insurance (EI), boosting the Canada Child Benefit (CCB) and GST rebates, and plans to ensure bank liquidity, along with various stimulus spending proposals. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump recently announced plans to implement several of these options. But while some of these policies may be necessary, they are unlikely to ensure continued social solidarity, compliance with public health measures or help arrest the looming cascade of debt defaults and the resulting stress on the financial system that will only make things worse. Photo by Evan Vucci/AP With the exception of expansions to EI, none of the policies announced Wednesday by the Canadian government directly deals with the obvious issue of lost wages that immediately affects unemployed workers. And, because they by and large do not target the people who need the help most, they fail to act as a necessary economic stabilizer or build trust and legitimacy among the broader public. They will not work as a means of maintaining economic activity, and perhaps more crucially, they will not secure the ongoing co-operation necessary to achieve the government's public health goals. Workers who are left behind are not likely to quietly suffer and comply. On both an individual and collective level, Canadians are acting quickly to protect the most vulnerable during this pandemic. They would be similarly supportive of policy proposals focused on helping the most vulnerable. A targeted income maintenance approach that is conditional on income - what we refer to as a ""targeted basic income"" - meets the urgency of the current crisis. And, because seniors and children already have a guaranteed annual income through the Old Age Security, Guaranteed Income Supplement and CCB programs, the major remaining gap in social policy must address the needs of low-income working-age people - particularly those without children. Working-age people who rely on employment and self-employment as their primary source of income will be most affected by widespread business closures. Working-age people who fall in the lower end of the income distribution will also be the most severely impacted, as they will qualify for lower EI benefits and are more likely to turn to social assistance in the near future due to having lower savings. With many low-income Canadians stretched by big debt loads, neither EI nor provincial social assistance benefits are likely to be enough. Moreover, asking people to apply for these benefits in the middle of a crisis - when many cannot work because of illness, quarantine or business shutdowns - is unnecessary. For this reason, we propose that the federal government immediately implement the provision of a monthly income of $1,000 to all individual working-age Canadians (ages 18-64) who had employment or self-employment income in 2019 between $1 and $50,000. The proposed amount of $1,000 a month is slightly higher than the average monthly social assistance provided to single working-age people in each province across the country. According to our calculations, the gross cost of this policy option is approximately $11.6 billion per month. We assume that provincial social assistance programs remain unchanged. If students are excluded, the cost decreases by about $1.4 billion. Including an additional cut-off based on total household income would more effectively target low-income families, and further reduce the cost. Given the current situation, no claw-back rate should be applied, either now, or next year at tax time. The Canada Revenue Agency could directly administer this targeted basic income, and no application would be needed. A related policy option that addresses many of the same concerns as the targeted basic income is the universal basic income (UBI). Because people are desperately searching for creative and effective policy solutions, the idea of an emergency (short-term) UBI has attracted support from all sides of the ideological spectrum. In both Canada and the United States, the idea has received support from both progressives and conservatives, and President Trump recently announced a direct cash transfer to all Americans. When everyone gets the same amount of money from the government, it is clearly equal. However, just as not every Canadian is equally vulnerable to the virus, not every Canadian is equally vulnerable to the impact of the economic slowdown. A UBI is therefore a less equitable policy, even in the best of times. It is also much less efficient at helping the most vulnerable than a targeted income maintenance approach that is conditional on income. A targeted basic income is a feasible, efficient and equitable option for addressing income precarity during this ongoing pandemic. It would provide a direct economic stimulus by putting money into the hands of the people who are most likely to spend it and, more importantly, into the hands of those who are most likely to need it.

"Opinion: The NHL provides a playbook on vaccinations, minus a mandate",https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/opinion-the-nhl-provides-a-playbook-on-vaccinations-minus-a-mandate,montrealgazette.com,"With new guidelines that reward players who get their shots, and penalize those who don't, the approach is good business.",['Sheldon H. Jacobson'],2021-09-07 00:00:00,"Photo by Allen McInnis / Montreal Gazette The NHL and its Players' Association released their 2021-22 COVID-19 guidelines. The message that they are conveying: get vaccinated or face significant restrictions and protocols that will make your life miserable and may cost you money if you become infected or if local restrictions limit your participation in team activities. The NHL guidelines are generally more stringent than other professional sports leagues. This is necessary because of the geographic diversity of the NHL - seven teams in Canada, requiring cross border travel that adds more complexity to following COVID-19 protocols. In contrast, the NFL has no teams outside the U.S., while MLB and the NBA each have one team based in Toronto. The takeaway from the new guidelines is that they reward vaccinated players and penalize those who opt not to be vaccinated. Unvaccinated players will be subject to severe limitations on what they can do when travelling for road games. If local regulations restrict movement of and activities for unvaccinated people, these players will be subject to those rules. If they are unable to participate in team activities due to such limitations, they might lose salary for any affected days. That could cost top end players as much as $30,000 per day. Unvaccinated players will be required to test daily. If they test positive, they might also lose pay. Recall what happened to Jon Rahm, the professional golfer who forfeited a near-certain victory at the Memorial Tournament in Columbus, Ohio, back in June because of a positive test, with reports that he was not vaccinated. Millions of dollars of financial penalties can accrue across multiple players if just one rogue infection seeps onto a team with several unvaccinated players. Vaccinated players are buffered from such losses, as any absences due to infections will be classified as a hockey-related injury, hence not subject to pay losses. The NFL has guidelines that are closest to those issued by the NHL. They include financial penalties of $14,650 for unvaccinated players not following safety protocols like mask wearing and physical distancing, with repeat violations leading to suspension and lost salary. However, they fall short of imposing penalties for unvaccinated players becoming infected and missing games or not being able to meet local COVID-19 guidelines for team activities. Without explicitly mandating vaccination, NHL players would be wise to be vaccinated, or risk losing playing time and salary. The complexity of managing local, regional and national COVID-19 regulations for cross-border games is simplified once a person is vaccinated. The vaccines have proven to be remarkably safe and effective, and the plethora of vaccine options in Canada and the U.S. make it straightforward to be vaccinated and comply with the NHL COVID-19 vaccination guidelines. The approach taken by the NHL is good business. Companies that do not want to mandate vaccination have created headwinds and penalties for those who opt not to be vaccinated. For example, Delta Air Lines is requiring every unvaccinated employee to contribute an extra $200 per month to their health insurance premium to cover the risk of additional health-care costs associated with COVID-19. The NHL guidelines also require coaches and team support personnel to be vaccinated, providing yet another layer of protection for the players. The guidelines do not mandate vaccination. However, the risks that come with not being vaccinated are significant. Weighing all these risks and benefits, the NHL is likely to have all or nearly all its players vaccinated. It makes good health sense, and for the teams and players, good financial sense. Sheldon H. Jacobson is a founder professor of computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Quebec made unvaccinated health workers an offer they couldn’t refuse. They refused,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-quebec-made-unvaccinated-health-workers-an-offer-they-couldnt-refuse/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"Before making The Godfather’s proverbial offer that can’t be refused, be sure it really can’t be refused. Otherwise, you end up with opponents emboldened and your moral authority in tatters",['The Editorial Board'],2021-11-05 06:00:00,"Quebec Health Minister Christian Dube speaks during a news conference on the COVID-19 pandemic, on Oct. 7, 2021, at the legislature in Quebec City.Jacques Boissinot/The Canadian Press On Wednesday, Quebec Health Minister Christian Dube announced he was dropping his long-standing plan to force health care workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19, or be fired. Also on Wednesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford's government declined to introduce a similar provincewide plan. Both of these are bad outcomes. But they may not be bad decisions. In Quebec, Mr. Dube described his policy reversal as the ""least bad"" decision. Under the circumstances, he's probably right. Back in the summer, Mr. Dube issued an ultimatum to the province's 330,000 health care workers: Get vaccinated by Oct. 15 (later extended to Nov. 15), or lose your job. It was a perfectly reasonable demand. You have to prove you're vaccinated to visit a patient in hospital; shouldn't you have to be vaccinated to work there? The question is an ethical and scientific no-brainer. But when you tell someone ""do this, or else,"" you'd better be sure they aren't going to choose ""or else."" . Which is where the government of Quebec finds itself. On Wednesday, Mr. Dube said that around 14,000 health care workers were without even a single shot, including approximately 5,000 front-line workers. That's only 3 per cent of those on the front line, but, if all were to be terminated, Quebec's health minister says it would lead to a cascade of cancellations and shortages across the entire system. Just 3 per cent of workers have so much leverage because Quebec health care was already short-staffed before COVID-19. For example, nurses in the province have long been forced to work mandatory overtime. Endless overtime leads to burnout, which leads to resignations, which leads to more staff shortages - and more mandatory overtime. It's a vicious circle (which Mr. Dube has promised to break), so when several thousand employees effectively blackmailed their colleagues, and health care, he blinked. But it's not the same situation in all provinces or sectors. Take the vaccine mandate at Canada's largest school board. On Nov. 2, the Toronto District School Board said that, of more than 42,000 workers, fewer than 800 had not attested to their vaccination status. What's more, the TDSB says the vast majority of the holdouts are part-time or occasional staff, most of whom have not worked this year. Only 16 are permanent teachers - out of a permanent teaching staff of more than 16,000. With 99.9 per cent of permanent teachers vaccinated, the TDSB has the leverage to make good on its ultimatum. Or consider British Columbia. It has a vaccine mandate in health care, and it isn't backing down. Health Minister Adrian Dix said on Monday that, of 127,500 health care workers, more than 3,300 are unvaccinated - and on unpaid leave. However, it's not as if those lost workers are not having an impact. For example, Mr. Dix said that Kelowna General Hospital had been forced to reduce the use of two operating rooms. The Interior Health region, with one-sixth of B.C.'s population, has one-third of the province's unvaccinated health workers. All of which points to why the Ford's government decision to hold off on imposing a single, provincewide vaccine mandate on Ontario's health care sector may not be such a bad choice. It may be a least-bad alternative - at least for Ontario, at least for now. Yes, in an ideal world the best policy - one this page repeatedly urged - would be a single, simple, provincewide order to all health care employees to get vaccinated. But when and where that perfect outcome isn't yet within reach, why not look to other approaches, at least in the short term? For example, many Ontario hospitals have their own vaccine mandates, and are suspending unvaccinated staff. They know their employees, and they know whether issuing a vaccination order in their institution or region will deliver more benefits than costs. If they think they can make a mandate stick, Queen's Park should be supporting them, rhetorically and financially. And along with local mandates, financial penalties for the unvaccinated (in Quebec they cannot receive pandemic bonus payments), a vaccination requirement for new hires, and regular testing of the unvaccinated (in place in Quebec and Ontario) can all nudge the ball toward the goal. The goal is getting vaccination in health care to 100 per cent - immediately where possible, gradually if necessary. In the long run, everyone working in health care in Canada should have to be vaccinated against COVID-19 as a condition of employment. Obviously. As the Ontario Hospital Association pointed out this week, the province's Public Hospitals Act already orders institutions to require employees to prove vaccination or immunity against 17 different conditions, from tuberculosis to measles. COVID-19 should of course be added to the list. But as Quebec's struggles show, there are some places in Canada where that may best be accomplished in stages, rather than all at once. When you hold all the cards, an ultimatum can be the winning strategy. Got a weaker hand? Open with subtlety, perseverance and patience. Keep your Opinions sharp and informed.

Opinion: Indigenous people are vaccine savvy - we don't need pampering woke saviours,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-indigenous-people-are-vaccine-savvy-we-dont-need-pampering-woke-saviours,nationalpost.com,The story seems to go that Indigenous people need special care and attention during the COVID vaccination program — just like children,"['Veldon Coburn', 'Special To National Post']",2021-03-18 00:00:00,"Opinion: Indigenous people are vaccine savvy - we don't need pampering woke saviours Opinion: Indigenous people are vaccine savvy - we don't need pampering woke saviours The story seems to go that Indigenous people need special care and attention during the COVID vaccination program - just like children Photo by MIGUEL RIOPA / AFP via Getty Images By Veldon Coburn Vaccine hesitancy could hinder the response to the pandemic in Canada, and news coverage is telling us that it is partly because Indigenous people are more resistant to inoculation compared to others. The truth is much different, but it departs from the narrative of the Indigenous population as wounded and broken people at the centre of some pity projects. Opinion: Indigenous people are vaccine savvy - we don't need pampering woke saviours For those who attach their sense of self-worth to their status as allies for Indigenous causes, a feel-good story of saviourism and righteous indignation certainly fits the bill. And when there is nothing of the sort to awaken do-gooder sensibilities, why not just make it up? As some voices from history tell us, never let a good crisis go to waste and never let the truth get in the way of a good story. Now the story seems to go that Indigenous people need special care and attention during the COVID vaccination program because of their experience at Indian Residential Schools and a general distrust of all things white and western. Because of this history and their general disposition towards medicine and health care, Indigenous people are not nearly as accepting of vaccination against COVID-19 as the rest of Canadians. The historic wounds of colonial history remain unhealed and, if we are to accept the Whiteman's medicine and get through this pandemic, we will need extra coddling - just like children. The reporting treats vaccination as a novel event for Indigenous people But the truth is, the Indigenous population doesn't need pampering by woke saviours. We are, for the most part, fairly savvy when it comes to our health and we are smart enough to discern the distant past from what's happening in our lives today. Yet you wouldn't know this when reading recent headlines. Global News ran with "" ‘ There is a lot of mistrust': Researchers look at vaccine hesitancy among Indigenous Canadians ."" With a similarly sensationalist headline in The Tyee, ""‘ A Matter of Trust': The Grim Reality Behind Indigenous Vaccine Fears,"" a non-Indigenous academic is quoted - with no awareness of the paternalism - as saying, ""if I was an Indigenous person, I would definitely have reasons to be wary."" The reporting offers no current data - beyond some exaggerated anecdotes - to support the broad claim that vaccine hesitancy is a problem within the Indigenous population, let alone a discretely Indigenous issue. What's more, it reaches into sensitive corners of Indigenous existence to needlessly exploit the legacy of residential schools. And it takes a very long reach to go back to events cited in the reporting, such as nutritional experiments in the 1940s, to make the connection to today. Even if we entertain the idea that residential schools and medical experiments did have adverse effects on Indigenous attitudes towards immunization, there is plenty of recent data to show that Indigenous people are now very much vaccine accepting. Residential schools and events that date back almost 80 years are simply far too remote to explain current Indigenous attitudes towards getting the jab. Oddly, some of the reporting treats vaccination as a novel and uncommon event for Indigenous people. But between the times of residential school atrocities, including medical experimentation on children, immunization has become a relatively routine health-care measure. Today we can get vaccinated for a variety of illnesses - such as Hepatitis A & B, shingles, typhoid, and meningococcal disease - while we shop at big box stores with pharmacies, like Costco and Walmart. Getting an injection is no longer experimental health care. If there is any lingering stigma of medical barbarity, it is difficult to ignore the considerable countervailing trends that have normalized vaccination for recent generations. For decades now, children have been given numerous vaccinations - in numerous doses - throughout much of their early years into early adulthood. As legal minors, these same children have been given a battery of vaccines despite their own attitudes towards needles and irrespective of their individual consent. Childhood vaccination is not just the norm, but in some places in Canada it is also legally compulsory. Since 1982, both Ontario and New Brunswick have required mandatory vaccination of minors attending school. We are a long way from the 1940s - unfortunately this needs to be pointed out because the passage of several generations is enough time for significant changes in attitudes and knowledge. Since that time Indigenous people have become considerably vaccine-accepting. But you don't have to take my word for it. As I pointed out in The Conversation , from which this article partly adapted from, there is plenty of recent data that dispels the myth of the fearful Indigenous person, cowering from western healthcare. Research from one of the more recent pandemics to impact Canada - the 2009-2010 H1N1 outbreak - is much more representative of contemporary Indigenous attitudes towards vaccination. In late 2010, Health Canada commissioned a survey of First Nations living on-reserve and Inuit about their knowledge, perceptions, awareness and behaviours relating to immunization. When asked about childhood vaccinations, about 97 per cent of First Nations living on-reserve and nearly 94 per cent of Inuit indicated that these immunizations were important. When both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people were asked about their attitudes towards the seasonal flu, we see that there isn't much of a difference in vaccination acceptance. From the 2017-18 Canadian Community Health Survey, 55 per cent of Indigenous people had a seasonal flu vaccine (excluding H1N1), compared to 59 per cent of non-Indigenous people. And when asked about the relative frequency of the seasonal flu vaccination, 36 per cent of Indigenous people and 42 per cent of non-Indigenous people said their most recent shot was within the last two years. So how did we get the Indigenous vaccine hesitancy myth? What's interesting to me - as both an Indigenous person and a researcher - is the source and motivation behind these distorted representations of Indigenous people. From my own experience, there appears to be a segment of self-anointed allies with an innate desire to be connected to victims, so much so that some will manufacture their victimhood and then pose as the guardian. We, as Indigenous people, are presented as constant victims and our ally-caretakers garner attention and adulation for saving us. It is particularly concerning to see these narratives produced by proud ""settler allies"" who seem to view Indigenous life as a childlike state of existence in need of parental protection from wider Canadian society. There is a sort of social suffocation that comes with these zealous allies. Their clinginess sometimes goes beyond mere irritation. There is a strong feeling of co-dependency where our constant state of victimhood and delicacy gives meaning to the lives of ultra-woke saviours. It is a sort of social Munchausen By Proxy. While there are many meritorious struggles that Indigenous people continue to face, we aren't always the unsuspecting victim. The need to position us in a state of perpetual oppression can have some ugly consequences. Having now been tarred with the same brush as anti-vaxxers, I can only imagine a post-COVID future where Indigenous people have to cope with similar stigma.

Battling to save unvaccinated patients has left me exhausted and demoralized,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-battling-to-save-unvaccinated-patients-has-left-me-exhausted-and/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"With COVID-19 surging in my small town, I wonder if I made the right decision to become a doctor here",['Kevin Mckechnie'],2021-09-24 08:00:00,"Kevin McKechnie is a family doctor in Nelson, B.C. Nelson is the bucolic mountain town in the Southern Interior of B.C. where I've had the privilege of working as a rural family physician for more than a decade. My colleagues and I practise a vanishing style of medicine that allows us to look after patients of all ages, through all stages, in both the community and in hospital. The work is gratifying and richly rewarding, and I never thought I'd question my plans to live out my career here. Sadly, events of the past few weeks have left me wondering. Until very recently, the pandemic largely spared our community. Owing to our remote location, and blind luck, case counts remained low. I had one patient who spent five weeks in ICU, but his case was an exception, and the scattered handful of local cases were generally mild and self-resolving. Our hospital was not overcapacity, our workloads not overly burdensome and a will to overcome the pandemic seemed to draw the community together. Then, a few weeks ago, everything changed. Since the beginning of August, Nelson and its surrounding communities have seen an exponential upsurge in COVID-19 cases. Our ICU is overcapacity, our hospital is full, our emergency department is seeing record daily visits, and our testing site can't keep up with daily demand. Worse still, modelling data suggest case numbers could continue to climb for the next four to five months. Almost all local patients requiring hospitalization for COVID-19 have been unvaccinated, and public-health data demonstrate that the continuing spread is perpetuated almost entirely through those who have chosen not to get vaccinated. My work as a family doc in this town has consequently become much more challenging. Today, typical of most days this past month, I started early and finished late. In addition to countless other encounters, I attempted to get an unvaccinated 23-year-old woman with worsening COVID-19 to the ICU, but failed because all the ventilators are in use. I called a patient to tell her that her aneurysm surgery has been indefinitely postponed because the hospital has no more capacity. I started an ordinarily resilient and vivacious patient on antidepressants, because after 18 months of trying to remain optimistic about his future, he is sinking. I witnessed a member of our clinic staff being verbally abused by an irate and indignant patient, offended at our clinic's mask policy. I was asked to write a ""medical exemption"" letter for a patient with no significant medical condition. I attempted to reassure a pregnant mother, terrified about delivering in our COVID-positive hospital. I cancelled a planned house call (for the second time) with a bed-bound stroke victim, who wanted to discuss Medical Assistance in Dying, because I got called back to hospital at the end of my clinic day. A summer of hubris has led Canada's health systems to the verge of collapse It will take more than money to solve the health care staffing shortage I care deeply about this town and the people in it. I am committed to providing my patients the highest-quality medicine I know how to deliver. I'm careful not to let bias or differences of opinion affect the care I provide. I am prepared to work as tirelessly as necessary to help get this pandemic under control and restore our town to a semblance of its previous idyllic self. Unfortunately, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to maintain my motivation. My non-judgmental approach is beginning to wane. I'm becoming exhausted and profoundly demoralized. The personal and professional toll on me, my colleagues and all those working in the health-care sector of our community is enormous. We have, in vaccines, a tool to put an end to all of this. The data are irrefutable. Should a sufficient number of the unvaccinated get inoculated, we could get our surging local outbreak under control in a matter of weeks. Unfortunately, our town continues to have one of the lowest vaccination rates in the province, and opposition to a vaccine passport program is vocal and strident. I implore the unvaccinated citizens of our community, and similar communities elsewhere, to step up and do the right thing. Denying the reality of what my colleagues and I are seeing daily is untruthful, demoralizing and harmful. Please prioritize the health of the people around you. Please put aside specious arguments about the erosion of civil liberties or the sanctity of personal health information until we're at last free of this devastating crisis. We are not being asked to go to war. We are simply being asked to acknowledge real-life evidence, trust in proven science and take a shot in the arm. Meanwhile, I'll continue to plug away in our hospital and in my clinic, and do what small things I can to help those affected by this pandemic. I'll remain hopeful that our town will get itself back on track, and that tolerance, respect and compassion will become the defining characteristics of our community, once again. I love my town, and I'd really like to stick around. Keep your Opinions sharp and informed. Get the Opinion newsletter. Sign up today."
Opinion: Let’s focus on what we can control: rapid testing for COVID-19.,https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-lets-focus-on-what-we-can-control-rapid-testing-for-covid-19,calgaryherald.com,It is time to stop pointing fingers.,['Calgary Herald'],2021-02-13 00:00:00,"Photo by Sean Gallup / Getty Images The vaccine rollout in Canada has not lived up to expectations. For a year that began with great hope at the marvel of quick vaccine development, contracts with leading vaccine manufacturers and the earlier-than-anticipated start of vaccinations, expectations have quickly dissipated. Today, Canada's inoculation rate of 3.33 per 100 people is below that of the United States (15.98) and the United Kingdom (23.33) and far below the world leaders in Israel (74.05), according to Our World in Data . As other countries vaccinate their populations faster than us, many leaders in the business community fear the impact on the Canadian economy. Vaccines are the surest way to safely and fully reopen our businesses and our workplaces. We have fallen behind but pointing fingers does not move us to a solution. As a business strategy professor and dean of the Haskayne School of Business, my approach is to set your goal, look at the situation around you, assess it carefully, and then develop and implement actions that remain focused on what you can control. Our goals are to save lives and to safely reopen our economy. To succeed in these goals, we must accelerate the vaccine plan by ensuring that Canadians have the information and knowledge they need to be comfortable in receiving the vaccine. In that regard, I am proud to be a part of an organization called 19 to Zero , led by Dr. Jia Hu, medical officer of health for the Calgary zone at Alberta Health Services. We are a dedicated coalition of academics, public health experts, health-care professionals, behavioural economists and creative professionals working to understand, engage with and ultimately shift public perceptions around COVID-19 behaviours and vaccination. However, recognizing that we cannot control the timing or physical delivery of vaccines, supplemental and contingent actions are necessary. An initiative I am proud to be associated with is the Creative Destruction Lab, which through its nine locations, including the Haskayne School of Business, started the CDL Rapid Screening Consortium in August 2020. The CDL approach - which is an objectives-based program for massively scalable, seed-stage and science- and technology-based companies - connects technology to business leaders on how to best deploy COVID-19 rapid tests. At the moment, the consortium consists of 12 major Canadian companies, including Air Canada, Suncor and Nutrien, which are part of a pilot project on the implementation of a rapid screening system for asymptomatic workers developed by the consortium in partnership with provincial governments. Through this pilot initiative, a playbook for the effective use of rapid testing is being developed, as well as a central data infrastructure to share de-identified data and accelerate learnings across a variety of workplaces. This promises to be a massive step forward because earlier detection is key to stopping the spread of COVID-19 and reopening the economy. The consortium is developing operational knowledge, an implementation strategy, and a method to share data across workplaces and with public health authorities to optimize learnings. In Alberta, we have not gotten off to a strong start with rapid testing. According to the CBC , Alberta has deployed just 17,000 of the 1.9 million rapid tests the province has received. We must do better. As a business community, indeed as a country, we must focus on what we can control. Rapid testing is one such measure within our grasp. There will be a time when it is necessary to assess where we went wrong and how to better prepare for the future. We must always be open to learning from others and from our mistakes. However, in this moment, we must face the situation at hand. The reality is that even with our best efforts we are well behind other countries in achieving herd immunity through vaccination. It is futile to focus our energies on finger-pointing, and equally futile to rely only on wishful thinking. We need to focus on reliable practical initiatives to ensure we are ready, willing, and able to be effective in the things that we control. Widespread access to rapid testing will be one of the many tools we will need to defeat this virus and maintain Canada's place as a leading economy. Let's focus on the task at hand.

After repeated lockdowns, long separations from friends and family, and economic losses, Canadians are lining up overnight at pop-up clinics and crashing websites with their eagerness to book appointments.

Experience from history suggests not. As historians Heather MacDougall and Laurence Monnais have argued, people do not get the recommended vaccines for a variety of reasons, including apathy. Another reason is misinformation, like the unfounded and discredited claim that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine can cause autism. Some are not convinced that the disease in question will impact them or their families. Others are deterred by the difficulty of accessing the vaccine. More than a few are scared of needles. We have seen all of these factors play out in past epidemics. We examined the response to polio and the H1N1 vaccines in Canada. At the height of the epidemics, Canadians were keen to get vaccinated, but vaccine enthusiasm waned once the crisis had passed. Parents were terrified by polio in the early decades of the 20th century. Usually striking in the otherwise carefree summer months, polio could leave children paralyzed. In some cases children were confined in iron lungs and in the very worst cases, death. The first trial of the Salk polio vaccine took place in the United States in 1954, using a vaccine produced in Toronto's Connaught Laboratories. The vaccine proved highly effective. Other laboratories were licensed to product the vaccine, but one of them, the Cutter Laboratories, failed to properly de-activate the polio virus and 79 children contracted polio from the vaccine. The U.S. halted the vaccination program on May 7, 1955. In Canada, a trial using the vaccine produced at the Connaught Laboratories continued. Health officials assured Canadians that the Connaught Laboratories product was safe and effective. By June 1956, 1.8 million Canadian children had been vaccinated. But this did not eradicate polio - there were significant epidemics in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The Salk vaccine schedule required three separate doses, making it a challenge to complete the full course of vaccination. Many adults believed that polio only impacted children and were reluctant to take the vaccine. Only 10 per cent of Canadian adults had received the required three doses of the Salk vaccine by June of 1959, compared to a rate of 90 per cent among school-aged children. The year 1959 was one of the worst years for polio in Canada, with nearly 2,000 paralytic cases. In Montreal there were over 950 cases and 51 fatalities. Across Canada, more young adults died than children between the ages of five and 19, most of the cases occurring among those who had not been vaccinated. During the 1959 epidemic people swamped the vaccination clinics in Montreal. And three years later, following an outbreak in Hull, Que., residents came to the vaccination clinics in droves. The introduction of the oral polio vaccine (Sabin vaccine) in 1961 led to an uptick in polio vaccinations. In just three months in 1962, over four million Canadians received the oral polio vaccine. Many adults who had resisted earlier appeals to get the Salk vaccine showed up to sip the tasteless Sabin vaccine, often served on a sugar cube. Newspapers raved that no needles were necessary. And by the 1970s, polio had all but disappeared in Canada. When the Salk vaccine came out, parents were very keen to have their children vaccinated, but young adults were not convinced that they were at risk and did not get vaccinated. Only after additional epidemics showed that they too could die or be paralyzed by polio did adults turn up to get vaccinated. The vaccination effort was further aided by tasty Sabin vaccine. In spring of 2009, a novel H1N1 influenza virus began spreading in Mexico. The first cases were reported in Canada that April. In June, the World Health Organization declared H1N1 to be a global pandemic. Like the flu of 1918-19, which killed as many as 50 million people around the world, the 2009 flu had a disproportionate impact on younger people. That fall, vaccination clinics opened across Canada for priority groups. Early polls showed that only one-third of Canadians planned to get the H1N1 vaccine, which was on par with seasonal flu shot vaccination rates. Less than perfect efficacy rates of the seasonal flu shot did little to inspire the Canadian public to seek out the H1N1 vaccine. But four days after vaccination clinics opened in Ontario, a previously healthy boy in Toronto died. The tragic news stirred fear among Ontarians, prompting thousands to rush to clinics. Many waited in line for hours, while others were turned away. Vaccines became available to all Ontarians in November 2009, but by then, people's fears had eased - it seemed that H1N1 was not as lethal as had originally been feared. Ultimately, between 40 and 45 per cent of the Canadian population was vaccinated against H1N1. Once again, vaccine enthusiasm was high in the middle of the crisis, but it diminished after the flu appeared to be less dangerous. Polio and H1N1 reveal the complexities of vaccine enthusiasm. People rush to get vaccines when they perceive an immediate health risk to themselves or their family members. But without that fear, it is easier to delay or avoid getting vaccinated. Many Canadians know someone who has gotten sick from COVID-19 and many have lost friends and family members to the disease. It's no wonder we are eager to get vaccinated. But enthusiasm may wane as case counts fall. If it proves that we need boosters, but case counts are low, will people make the same effort to get out to the vaccine clinics? The biggest challenge may be ensuring the continuing uptake of vaccines once the initial crisis has passed. In addition to measures to combat vaccine misinformation, public health authorities need to ensure that vaccines are readily available and convenient to access.

"The ivermectin mess: People are embracing a dangerous livestock drug, while rejecting vaccines",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-the-ivermectin-mess-people-are-embracing-a-dangerous-livestock-drug/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"Feed stores across Canada and the U.S. are being inundated by demands for the livestock de-worming drug ivermectin because people are convinced it prevents/treats Covid-19. Meanwhile, they refuse to be vaccinated because they believe it’s a dangerous drug.",['André Picard'],2021-08-31 20:10:15,"Prior to the pandemic, there were roughly 3,600 prescriptions of ivermectin, a livestock deworming drug, each week in the U.S. That number has soared to 88,000 weekly and counting as some people have been using it with the false belief that it can prevent or treat COVID-19.LUIS ROBAYO/AFP/Getty Images ""You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, y'all. Stop it."" With that cheeky tweet, the U.S Food and Drug Administration issued a plea to Americans to stop buying ivermectin, a livestock deworming drug that far too many people falsely believe can prevent or treat COVID-19. While the tone was lighthearted, the issue is deadly serious. Prior to the pandemic, there were roughly 3,600 ivermectin prescriptions a week in the U.S. That number has soared to 88,000 weekly and counting. That's a 24-fold increase in demand for the drug that doesn't work the way people think it does. The trend of people self-medicating with veterinary drugs is now carrying over into Canada, with feed stores and pharmacies alike reporting a deluge of demand. So why is this happening? Why is there so much delusional grasping at straws? First and foremost, there is the push from right-wing media and politicians, notably by Fox News host Tucker Carlson, and politician Rand Paul, two of ivermectin's biggest disciples. In Canada, there is radio host and podcaster Danielle Smith and maverick MP Derek Sloan singing from the same hymn book. Sadly, anti-science contrarianism sells. Demand surges for deworming drug for COVID-19, despite no evidence it works Then there is social media, where disinformation and quackery flourish unabated. The discussions taking place in Facebook and Reddit groups range from shockingly naive to disturbingly bizarre. There is clearly a direct link between anti-vaxxers and ivermectin boosters. Those who are vehemently opposed to COVID-19 vaccination argue that the shots are ineffective, deadly, alter DNA, contain microchips and G5 technology and a whole other host of conspiracy-based nonsense about Big Pharma, mind control and lord knows what else. Ivermectin, on the other hand, is touted as a safe, effective drug that is being denied to the public to ensure profits for Bill Gates, Big Pharma, their media co-conspirators and such. The cognitive dissonance is striking: Embracing an unproven and dangerous livestock drug, while rejecting a vaccine that has been remarkably safe and effective in 5.3 billion doses so far. Pity the feed store owners who have found themselves with a new clientele they don't really want. It should go without saying that humans should not be taking drugs meant for horses, cows and sheep. Even if ivermectin were helpful - and it is for many parasitic conditions, but not for viral COVID-19 - the veterinary formulations sold in paste and liquid form are 10-15 times the dose of a capsule designed for human treatment. The dose makes the poison. In some U.S. states, like Mississippi (where vaccine rates are abysmally low), 70 per cent of poison hotline calls are now from people ingesting veterinary ivermectin. The symptoms are nasty. You don't need a lot of imagination to figure out how a deworming drug works, but let's just say that filling your boots is on the menu - literally, not figuratively. Then there is the vomiting, low blood pressure, seizures, and hallucinations. It makes the post-vaccine sore arm and lethargy look good. One of the real tragedies here is that ivermectin is an amazing drug - when used properly. The discovery of avermectins, a new class of drugs, in the 1970s was world-changing, even earning a trio of researchers the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Thanks to cheap anti-parasitics, the horrible tropical illness river blindness (onchocerciasis) has virtually been eliminated, and elephantitis (lymphatic filariasis) can be treated. There are also many other uses, like treatment of scabies, lice, rosacea and even calming the sore tummies of cows and horses. Theoretically, ivermectin might help with viral illnesses like COVID-19, dengue and HIV, because it slows viral replication - at least in test tubes. But, in the real world, the research results have been disappointing. So far, there have been 14 studies looking at ivermectin as a potential prevention or treatment of COVID-19, and they have all failed. That includes one highly-publicized study, which purported ivermectin could slash COVID-19 mortality by 90 per cent. Unfortunately, it was a dog's breakfast of fudged data, plagiarism and fraud. There are 31 more studies under way. There is no cover-up here. On the contrary. But there is also no reason for self-described ‘independent thinkers' to be poisoning themselves with horse medicine when there is a perfectly effective drug available to all in the form of a vaccine.

Opinion: Don't steal from Peter to vaccinate Paul,https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-dont-steal-from-peter-to-vaccinate-paul,financialpost.com,Governments and charities should purchase vaccines and either donate them or sell them at discounted prices to poorer countries,"['Miguel Ouellette', 'Special To Financial Post']",2021-06-02 00:00:00,"Photo by Andres Yepez/Reuters files With the COVID-19 vaccination campaign going smoothly in wealthier countries like ours, attention is turning to poorer countries where access to the vaccines is more difficult. Not only is it fair that everyone benefit from this great scientific feat, it's also the only way of reducing the global risk posed by more virulent variant strains of the virus. But what's the best way of achieving this goal? Politicians in many countries are calling for the waiver of intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines. While their motives may be pure, and the idea is at first glance alluring, it doesn't pass the fairness test. If countries like ours are currently well on their way to defeating COVID-19 and resuming our normal lives, it is first and foremost thanks to the genius and perseverance of scientists and the pharmaceutical companies that employ them. Depriving them of ownership of the fruits of their labour and investment sounds more like a vendetta than a measure meant to help poorer countries. Populists may decry the fact that the companies that conceived and now manufacture these vaccines stand to make a healthy profit in 2021, but we mustn't lose sight of the fact that profit is the engine of our economic system. If there is no profit at the end of months or years of hard work, we can expect a lot less money to be invested into getting such work done. Fellow feeling and a sense of common cause will only get us so far. For the sake of preserving our ability to innovate in the future, we can't afford to set such a destructive precedent. Canada already has a shaky relationship with pharmaceutical companies. By and large, they have eschewed manufacturing in this country, a fact made painfully obvious by our inability to produce vaccines domestically. Now that Canada is finally trying to attract investments from these very companies, it would be awfully counterproductive to attack their intellectual property rights. By and large, we live in a populist era. But we can't afford to lose sight of our goal, which is to get people in poorer countries vaccinated, not to attack those currently making a profit for having created the vaccines that will set us free. The good news is that there are many ways of doing this that do not involve robbing Peter to vaccinate Paul. After all, when Canada decides to send food to countries facing starvation, we do not steal it from farmers and food producers. We buy it from them. Nothing else offers a viable or repeatable solution. The most efficient recourse is the most direct one: . This is already happening indirectly: In the case of the Pfizer vaccine, wealthier countries are effectively subsidizing the sale of vaccines to poorer countries at cost. More On This Topic Opinion: Canada should block a patent waiver for COVID vaccines Opinion: On COVID-19 vaccines, the safe bet was the wrong bet Opinion: Think the vaccine shortage is bad? Wait until you see what price regulations do to our drug supply Opinion: Breaking vaccine patents will only make the next pandemic worse Another such initiative is the COVAX program led by the World Health Organization. Countries with the means to do so, like the United States, are working with COVAX in order to send vaccines to countries in dire need of more jabs. Some COVAX members, including Canada, made the morally dubious decision to take COVAX allotments when their own supplies ran low. Perhaps Canadian politicians musing publicly about an intellectual property waiver for vaccines are trying to make up for interfering with poor countries getting more shots just a few months ago. If so, it's a misguided guilt trip. In the weeks and months ahead, Canada should use its influence and financial heft to buy vaccines for countries that can't afford them and call on other countries and civil society to do their part as well. Together, we can ensure that everyone on the planet gets as many jabs as necessary. And we can do it without demonizing the vaccine producers who in fact have been the crisis' angels.

Omicron variant could change the rules. Our leaders’ playbook should go beyond the hope strategy,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/2021/11/29/omicron-variant-could-change-the-rules-our-leaders-playbook-should-go-beyond-the-hope-strategy.html,www.thestar.com,"Comments by Ontario’s chief medical officer of health sounded nothing like the precautionary principle, amid many unknowns. But an expected accelerati...",['Bruce Arthur'],2021-11-29 00:00:00,"It's hard to know just how seriously to take Omicron, while taking it very seriously indeed. It's a variant of concern, and the world's virologists are inhaling data. Omicron might be more transmissible, and might make people sicker, and it might reduce the protection of vaccines, and it might be Delta wearing a hat. We'll find out soon enough. And Ontario didn't move much Monday, but it will soon. Chief medical officer of health Dr. Kieran Moore gave a press conference that was designed to be reassuring, right down to the light reception room music playing in the background. He emphasized waiting to find out what's coming. It seemed notable that the first two cases of Omicron in Ontario were picked up by a random arrival test, in passengers from Nigeria, which is not on Canada's banned travel list. Ottawa confirmed two more, and Hamilton is investigating two, all travel-related. The federal government can start testing every traveller on arrival any damned time, but this thing is almost certainly loose in the world. So the next questions are what does the virus do, and what do we do? The province holds the most levers, if it chooses to use them. Better be ready. ""When we saw Delta take over to be a dominant strain it was a three- to four-month transition,"" said Moore. ""We will have to see if we can limit the rapidity of spread of Omicron as well as attenuate or limit its ability to spread in our communities … it may be a two- to three-month transition if it's more effective than Delta, and then we'll have to put in the precautions that are necessary. ""I don't foresee us having to take any steps back at present. We will, though, need to completely understand if it's more virulent, if it increases the risk for hospitalization."" That's pretty far from anything like a precautionary principle, and Ontario is a province with a history of waiting, dumbly, to see if the virus will do what the experts predict it will do. But Moore also said to expect an acceleration of the third-shot booster program by week's end, and sources indicate the most likely age range to be announced is 50-plus. Some prominent voices have called for just that, and it would be a more proactive approach than the province has taken so far. There are logistical hurdles. There are fewer health-care professionals available to do the vaccinating, and the family doctor piece hasn't come together, and the system is already vaccinating five-to-11-year-olds. But just 6.4 per cent of the eligible five-to-11 population have been vaccinated over the first four early-adopting days, though not every public health unit had opened appointments. It may be messy, opening up boosters within a week or two. But if Ontario wants to be ahead of the virus for once, it will be a good start. So what else? Israel moved hard on ventilation, contact tracing, boosters, and border restrictions, because Israel knows an emergency when it sees one. If Omicron is a real leap - and many virologists say its 25 to 30 mutations are at least hypothetically suited to potential immunity evasion, transmission and virulence - then the rules of the game will change. Some would likely stay the same, too. This government has set certain boundaries at this point which will influence the vulnerability to whatever Omicron or any other variant might be. It's a broken record at this point, but this government has been truly reluctant to push vaccination from the premier on down. The result is about 1.4 million unvaccinated Ontarians over the age of 12, including some 350,000 over the age of 50. Every one is a walking alarm bell. At the same time the province has clearly expressed a preference toward autopilot, twirling into what it hopes is a glorious future, with goals for expiring vaccine passports and mask mandates that served no real purpose other than to encourage the unvaxxed to wait out the winter. Ontario is again letting local public health units create a patchwork of local restrictions - and keep an eye on Haldimand-Norfolk, where the virus is already rolling - and is highly resistant to the idea of province-wide measures ever again. A couple of weeks ago Moore said he couldn't see the province going backwards, but only specifically mentioned the schools. That would be the appropriate second priority, after health care. But the flip side is Ontario could expand vaccination mandates, could re-expand testing, could make vaccine passports more durable - Manitoba's actual ID cards are less prone to fraud and a stronger signal - and could actually start enforcing rules on infractions regarding masking, or vaccine passports. The province could, in other words, take this more seriously. Boosters are almost the easy one. There are tools to control this virus, whether it mutates or not. Vaccination is number one. So Moore can talk about ICU capacity and therapeutics, and can muse about whether Omicron is less fatal based on what seem like small early signals if they're even signals at all. But that can't be the plan, unless the plan is to hope the virus finds those unvaccinated Ontarians slowly enough that surgeries and screenings aren't cancelled. (Which is, to be fair, what it looks like.) And even if Omicron IS only Delta in a hat, there was already plenty of room for Delta to ransack places like Algoma, Sudbury, Timiskaming, and now parts of southwestern Ontario. If you think you're tired, imagine how doctors and nurses feel. Don't overreact to anecdotal data; don't jump ahead of the science, unless a reputable virologist or two goes there first. You're allowed to hope Omicron is a mirage, and that would be some hellaciously welcome news. But the people in charge should be truly prepared to admit hope is not a strategy, and never really was. There could be a lot at stake here, and either way, boosters will be a start. Just maybe not the end."
Every minister of every cabinet across Canada must be vaccinated,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-every-minister-of-every-cabinet-across-canada-must-be-vaccinated/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"Cabinet consensus has been key to government responses to COVID-19. To ensure we don’t risk that crucial element, every federal and provincial cabinet minister needs to follow public-health advice",['David Mclaughlin'],2021-11-16 16:00:00,"David McLaughlin was cabinet secretary and clerk of the Executive Council in the province of Manitoba from 2020 to 2021. When the House of Commons returns to session on Nov. 22, members of Parliament will need to be fully vaccinated unless they have a medical exemption. This has caused some consternation around the Conservative Party of Canada's caucus - the party has yet to disclose its MPs' vaccination statuses, and how many of them remain unvaccinated. But these concerns miss the mark. It matters not a hill of beans to the actual public health of Canadians whether elected members of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition are vaxxed to the max or not. They do not, after all, make public-health policy. Cabinet, on the other hand, is a different matter. It is here, at the apex of our system of responsible government, that the following question should be posed to every federal and provincial minister in every cabinet across this country: Are you vaccinated or not? A minority of unvaccinated government caucus members poses minimal risk to public-health policy-making. It is exponentially greater if a misinformed but committed opponent to vaccination is sitting at the cabinet table. Cabinet is the highest executive decision-making forum in government - caucus, meanwhile, is essentially a political focus group for a premier or prime minister. Caucus can be consulted on any matter of government policy, but its entreaties can ultimately be ignored. They are not members of the executive branch. But ministers in cabinet cannot be so easily discounted. They are directly engaged in public-health policy determination, unlike members of Parliament or members of a Legislative Assembly. An opponent of vaccinations in caucus carries some weight, but is always generously outnumbered in the room. But such a person in cabinet would be less so. Their proximity to confidential decision-making information in the form of cabinet documentation and access to public health officials and other government experts gives them a privileged perch to create mischief at best, and radically inadequate public health policy at worst. Strident anti-vaxxers in cabinet can bring an insidious bearing to decision-making. If they cannot halt new public-health orders outright, they can certainly water them down by voicing ill-informed views where decisions are made or ratified. In the search for consensus at this most privileged of tables, those ministers can create a dynamic that delays needed action. A vociferous opponent of vaccination will just as likely oppose any and all public-health restrictions, period. Residing in an echo chamber of a broad array of classic conspiracy theories, these destabilizing elements have the ability to influence many aspects of government responses to COVID-19, given that such edicts have fundamentally reshaped all human interactions during the pandemic. This poses a threat to that most important element and most ideal outcome of cabinet-based decision-making: consensus. At those cabinet tables, consensus is most properly understood as ""the absence of active disagreement"" - a delightfully ambiguous construction that serves cabinet government well. In such styles of government, consensus is effectively stated by the premier or prime minister - who, as chair of cabinet, are charged with summing up the opinions and views and making a determination on behalf of the government as a whole. In short, ministers get a vote; the party leader gets a veto. Or, put more starkly: Cabinet consensus is whatever the premier or prime minister says it is. This is a powerful instrument in the hands of a determined leader. Wielded skilfully, it enables divergent opinions to coalesce around a common cause, at least for a given moment. And that is often success enough, in the uncertain arc of any government's life. However, a premier or prime minister who repeatedly ignores opposing views from cabinet colleagues will encounter other reckonings over time. It takes a strong, canny leader to deflect this direct challenge to majority opinion amongst other ministers or in extremis to a premier's very leadership. This is particularly difficult when a minister dissents because of views that run counter to public-health recommendations. Our public battle against COVID-19 has actually been most consequentially fought in private, around cabinet tables. The quest to secure this bedrock of responsible government - consensus - has been the strongest dynamic shaping our governments' responses to this pernicious and persistent virus. As the pandemic has ground on, cabinet consensus in every government across the country on public-health action have been set and reset more than any citizen knows. But without cabinet consensus, there is no cabinet government. Allowing any anti-vaxxers to sit at the cabinet table presents a clear conflict of interest when it comes to acting in the public good against COVID-19. It is cabinet, not caucus, where vaccine mandates most matter. Keep your Opinions sharp and informed. Get the Opinion newsletter. Sign up today."
Childhood vaccination is a pathway out of the pandemic and parents should embrace it,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-childhood-vaccination-is-a-pathway-out-of-the-pandemic-and-parents/,www.theglobeandmail.com,The benefits of vaccinating kids against COVID-19 far outweigh the risks,['André Picard'],2021-11-15 14:19:39,"As early as this week, Health Canada could give the green light to a pediatric formulation of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. That means the 2.7 million Canadian children aged 5 to 11 could start getting their shots before Christmas. Regulatory approval will set the stage for what is arguably the most important childhood vaccination campaign since polio in the 1950s. When it rolled out, the excitement was palpable, and there was a virtual stampede to vaccine clinics. Today, the political and social environment is fraught, and misinformation is rampant. A recent Angus Reid poll showed that barely half of parents, 51 per cent, plan to get their elementary-school-aged children vaccinated promptly. Another chunk, 18 per cent, say they will do so eventually, while a shocking 23 per cent say they have no intention of getting their kids vaccinated against COVID-19 at all. We should try to understand the paradox of the vaccine-hesitant health care worker The pandemic is, more than ever, a pandemic of the unvaccinated This level of hesitancy in the midst of a pandemic that has dragged on for almost two years is troubling. The pandemic will never end unless we get the near totality of the population immunized, including young people. And the best path to immunity is vaccination, not illness. Sabina Vohra-Miller, founder of Unambiguous Science, has come up with a great list of six reasons kids aged 5 to 11 should get vaccinated: 1) It protects them from COVID-19 illness, hospitalization and death. 2) It protects them from long-term effects of infections, such as MIS-C (multisystem inflammatory syndrome) and long COVID. 3) We cannot predict which children will end up having severe illness or long COVID. 4) Doing so allows children to get back to doing things they love and miss. 5) The benefits of vaccinating far outweigh the risks. 6) Vaccinations contribute to herd immunity, community protection and a pathway back to normalcy. Those are all pretty convincing arguments for embracing vaccination, individually and collectively. Why wouldn't we do everything in our power to prevent children from getting sick? And why aren't we more eager to break chains of transmission in the community, and put the pandemic (and all the irritating public-health measures it has prompted) behind us? Parents all want the best for their children. So some hesitation and worry is understandable. But, in the main, parents recognize the overwhelming benefits of vaccines. That's why childhood vaccination rates hover around 90 per cent in Canada. So why are the same parents who want to protect their beloved babies against measles, mumps, chicken pox, whooping cough and more - conditions we rarely see any more, thanks to vaccination - so reluctant to protect them against the in-our-face coronavirus? A large part of the problem is the persistent false narrative that children are not at risk from COVID-19. It is true that children are less at risk than adults, but that does not mean there is no risk. In Canada, 2.2 per cent of COVID-19 hospitalizations, 1.4 per cent of intensive-care admissions and 0.1 per cent of deaths have been in the pediatric population. Two arguments are routinely put forward to downplay these data. One, that most children affected by COVID-19 have ""underlying conditions"" such as cancer, asthma and Down syndrome. That's true. But protecting the most vulnerable should be an argument in favour of vaccination, not against it. Further, at least one-third of hospitalized children were ""perfectly healthy"" before infection. Also, almost 5 per cent of children infected with the coronavirus have persistent symptoms that last for months. One of the most bizarre arguments against vaccination is that ""not many children die."" Well, let's be clear about this: Children should not die. Period. There have been 17 pediatric COVID-19 deaths in Canada. That's 17 too many, even if it's 0.1 per cent of the total. (For the record, one-tenth of 1 per cent of all deaths in Canada occur in children, 359 of 284,082 last year.) None have died of vaccination, and none will. The most important point in Ms. Vohra-Miller's list is No. 5 - that benefits far outweigh risks. Parents have been fed misinformation and fear-mongering by the shovelful. By every measure, COVID-19 vaccines are incredibly safe. The single biggest fear out there is needle pain but that's largely avoidable. As the great Canadian social-media campaign says in its hashtag: #ItDoesntHaveToHurt. Despite oft-repeated nonsense (usually by charlatans flogging ""alternative"" treatments), vaccination has no impact on DNA, hormones or fertility. Even real concerns such as myocarditis are minimal risks and, again, far more likely to occur with COVID-19 infection than with vaccination.

OPINION: Canada's COVID-19 strategy is an assault on the working class,https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-canadas-covid-19-strategy-is-an-assault-on-the-working-class,torontosun.com,"By Martin Kulldorff and Sunetra Gupta, Special to Postmedia Network",['Special To Toronto Sun'],2020-11-20 00:00:00,"Photo by Carlos Osorio / REUTERS Canada is known for caring for all its citizens, through for example universal health care and excellent public schools. What changed? The Canadian COVID-19 lockdown strategy is the worst assault on the working class in many decades. Low-risk college students and young professionals are protected; such as lawyers, government employees, journalists, and scientists who can work from home; while older high-risk working-class people must work, risking their lives generating the population immunity that will eventually help protect everyone. This is backwards, leading to many unnecessary deaths from both COVID-19 and other diseases. While anyone can get infected, a key feature of COVID-19 is that there is more than a thousand-fold difference in the risk of death between the oldest and the youngest. In fact, children have much less risk from COVID-19 than from the annual influenza. Considering this, we must do a much better job protecting the elderly and other high-risk groups until a vaccine is available. As a contrast, children should go to school in-person while we encourage young adults to live near normal lives to minimize the collateral damage from the pandemic. For them, the public health damage from lockdowns is worse than their minimal risk from COVID-19. Following basic public health principles and numerous pandemic preparedness plans, this is a focused protection strategy, as outlined in the Great Barrington Declaration, with accompanying details on how to properly protect the elderly. Schools and universities are not only critical for education, but also for physical and mental health and social development. It is positive that most Canadian schools are open for in-person teaching, but not all students are attending, even though there is no public health rationale for keeping them away. To be scientific about it, we must look at Sweden. It was the only major western country that kept day care and schools open for all children ages 1 to 15 throughout the height of the pandemic in the spring. Without any masks, testing, contact tracing or social distancing, there were exactly zero COVID-19 deaths among the 1.8 million children in this age group, with only a few hospitalizations. Moreover, teachers had the same risk as the average of other professions, while older people living in multi-generational homes did not have higher risk if living with children. To test and isolate children and parents are harmful to children and families without serving a public health purpose. Despite heroic efforts by the public, the nine-month lockdown and contact tracing strategy has tragically failed older Canadians, with 97% of COVID-19 deaths inflicting those over 60. Where it did ""succeed"" was in shifting the COVID-19 burden from affluent professionals to the less affluent working class. For example, in Toronto, the incidence rates were the same at the beginning of the pandemic, but after the March 23 lockdowns, detected cases declined in affluent neighborhoods while they skyrocketed in less affluent areas. A similar effect was subsequently observed for mortality (see Figure). While it is impossible to protect anyone 100% during a pandemic, the notion that we cannot better protect the elderly and other high-risk groups is nonsense. It is not harder to protect the old than it is to protect the affluent, and the former leads to fewer deaths. Lockdowns have generated enormous collateral damage on other health outcomes, such as plummeting childhood vaccination rates, worst cardiovascular disease outcomes, less cancer screening, and deteriorating mental health, just to name a few. Even if all lockdowns are lifted tomorrow, this is something that we will have to live with - and die with - for many years to come. One of the basic principles of public health is to consider all health outcomes, and not only a single disease. Having thrown that principle out the window, we urgently need to bring it back to minimize mortality and to maximize overall health and well-being.

OPINION: Marching on through pandemic,https://www.thegraphicleader.com/opinion/editorials/opinion-marching-on-through-pandemic,www.thegraphicleader.com,"Well, it’s March again, can you believe it?",['Ryan Stelter'],2021-03-03 00:00:00,"Photo by Wayne Marcino We've been living in this pandemic for nearly a year now, and although light at the end of the tunnel can be seen with the arrival of vaccines we still have a long way to go. Things like social distancing, home offices, online meetings, adding virtual to nearly everything and consistent isolation have all been thrust into our daily lives. We know the difference between an N95 and a surgical mask and now one feels naked without a face covering on while out in public. These are all things we've adopted to push through this global health crisis and for some strange reason, it feels like the past 12 months have gone by slowly, but also so fast. It doesn't feel like that long ago where I was holed up with my family in Winnipeg working from home and religiously watching the daily numbers in Manitoba. The news was on constantly, and everyone seemed to become an expert on the novel coronavirus, which doesn't seem too ""novel"" anymore. Provinces declared states of emergencies, the feds brought in the much-maligned or celebrated (depends on who you ask) Canada Emergency Response Benefit. In the beginning, it seemed fascinating, seeing pictures of busy squares in New York, Tokyo and Toronto that were empty didn't feel real. This stuff happens in movies, I kept thinking, not in real life. But sure enough, it was very, very real. A recurring saying was ""We were due for a global pandemic, it's been about 100 years since the Spanish Flu."" Scientists and researchers came out of the woodwork touting papers they wrote foreshadowing this event, and we probably should've listened to them. Alas, we perhaps have learned a lot about how we operate as a society. Cracks became gorges and the wealth inequality and the shrinking middle class we see in not only Canada but the United States has been top of mind for many. CEOs of big companies have seen their wealth skyrocket since the pandemic started, while many small businesses have been forced to close their doors and watch big box stores keep their doors open. The Washington Post reported that America's big executives such as former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and SpaceX's Elon Musk had added about US$1 trillion to their net worth. Certainly, the conditions in long-term care homes were thrust into our faces. Harrowing stories came from Quebec early in the pandemic and even more stories have come to light telling of the poor conditions our elderly are living in. Things still need to be improved in our long-term care homes because we owe it to the people living there. Online classes and virtual learning also has been something we've seen as a result of this pandemic. Although in-class learning has returned, it most likely does not feel the same and I'm sure schools are nowhere near as fun as they used to be. I know as a newspaperman in a small town, schools have always been a source for fun stories to write about. I always enjoyed taking in all the school sports Kenora has to offer and chatting with teachers and students. As a big sports fan, being able to watch pro sports on television has been a nice reprieve lately. I didn't think sports would happen for a while and even though there have been plenty of hiccups and questions as to why they're allowed to happen, it's offered a sense of normalcy in this far-from normal time. Local sports returning to Kenora's rinks, gyms and fields will be a welcome sight, whenever that is allowed to happen. The same can be said for the arts and missing music festivals. Kenora has a vibrant cultural scene, with plenty of talented artists living in this lake town and it's been a shame we haven't been able to see them perform. Who knows when concerts will be able to happen again? If this pandemic has taught me anything, is that I should not take for granted what you have right in front of you. And for us living in Kenora, we have the beautiful Canadian Shield dotted with hidden lakes and backcountry hiking trails that could keep you busy for a lifetime. I've certainly spent more time outdoors than I ever have simply because that's all there is to do. Ice fishing has become a regular occurrence for so many people this winter and it's something I encourage you to try before the weather gets too warm. Bombing around Lake of the Woods on the ice roads is a lot of fun and catching your limit's worth of walleye makes it that much better. This crisis is far from over and the pandemic-related fatigue has set in, but we have to keep pushing. We'll get through this. Show kindness and as always, take care of yourselves, Kenora."
Will the pain of death actually be a wake-up call for unvaccinated Americans?,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-will-the-pain-of-death-actually-be-a-wake-up-call-for-unvaccinated/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"It may be perverse, but the COVID deaths of prominent anti-vaccination activists in the U.S. could serve as a real incentive to get vaccinated",['Robyn Urback'],2021-09-15 15:53:11,"Workers plant white flags as part of artist Suzanne Brennan Firstenberg's temporary art installation, In America: Remember, in remembrance of Americans who have died of COVID-19, on the National Mall in Washington, Sept. 15, 2021.Patrick Semansky/The Associated Press Bob Enyart, a Colorado pastor infamous for mocking AIDS victims on his TV show in the nineties, recently urged his followers to decline COVID-19 vaccines. Writing on his website, he acknowledged that it is ""not inherently sinful to take an immorally-developed vaccine,"" referring to the use of fetal cell lines in the development of the vaccines, but nevertheless implored his followers to boycott Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson ""to further increase social tension and put pressure on the child killers."" Nashville talk radio host Phil Valentine, who repeatedly expressed skepticism both about the seriousness of the virus and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, said he wasn't going to risk heart attack or paralysis by getting the shot. Scott Apley, a local Texas politician, filled his Facebook page with antimask and anti-vaccine comments and memes. Marc Bernier, a Florida talk-radio host, proudly labelled himself ""Mr. Anti-Vax."" Dick Farrell, another Florida talk-radio host, called COVID-19 vaccines ""poison."" All of these men are now dead, having eschewed the buoy that might have kept them from drowning. These stories are becoming more common as the Delta-driven fourth wave tears through unvaccinated communities in the United States: outspoken anti-vaxxers, who use their pulpits to proselytize about the supposed dangers of vaccination, are succumbing to the actual and evermore present danger of the virus. If the COVID-19 pandemic isn't an emergency demanding real leadership, what is? Will the COVID-19 pandemic become endemic? The charitable view to take on deaths of the aforementioned men and people like them is that they were hopelessly misguided - victims of a social ecosystem perverted by misinformation and knee-jerk contrarianism. The less charitable view - and likely the more ubiquitous one, if we're honest about the nature of our rather vicious species - probably finds some schadenfreude in hearing about these once-defiant people eating the ultimate crow. After all, not only did these people risk their own lives by shirking vaccination, but they also encouraged their followers to take a dip in the ocean and leave the lifeboat behind. The pace of vaccination in the U.S. reached a peak around the middle of April, when more than three million first or second shots were administered daily. The number of first doses dropped off dramatically after that, reaching an average low of just a few hundred thousand daily at the beginning of July. But when the Delta variant started sending the unvaccinated to hospitals in droves, overwhelming hospitals in Missouri, Florida, Texas and other states where vaccination rates had stagnated or remained low all along, people again started lining up for first doses. The increase in new reported deaths, which has been rising since mid-July and shows no sign of slowing down, appears to have achieved what vaccine incentives, education and threats of mandates could not: it has convinced some hesitant Americans to finally roll up their sleeves. As a result, the United States now finds itself in a perverse scenario where death could actually be seen as a social good - ghoulish and taboo as that might be to acknowledge - if it compels those who are hesitant to concede to vaccination. Observing illness alone doesn't seem to do the trick. Indeed, some influential people who have contracted and recovered from COVID-19 have emerged even more defiant, peddling unproven theories that they credit for their recovery. Podcaster Joe Rogan - who had, in April, declared on his massively popular show that young and healthy people need not be vaccinated - recently recovered from COVID-19 but defended his use of Ivermectin, a drug used to treat parasitic conditions but unproven against COVID-19. And though some had hoped that the bout former U.S. president Donald Trump faced would leave him humbled and perhaps compel him to urge others to take the virus more seriously, he returned to the White House defiant as ever. ""Don't be afraid of Covid,"" he tweeted after receiving state-of-the-art care and treatments that were inaccessible at the time to average Americans. ""Don't let it dominate your life."" Stories of people contracting and recovering from COVID-19, even if they suffer greatly in the interim (as Mr. Trump reportedly did), just don't seem to have the persuasive power of death. The news that Mr. Enyart died for the sake of his vaccine boycott, or that Mr. Valentine died of COVID-19 because he didn't want the remote risk of dying of a heart attack, or that Mr. Farrell's lungs filled with infection because he believed a syringe was filled with ""poison"" - such sad but blunt lessons could actually help Americans overcome their hesitation. Observers tend to remember outcomes - death or recovery - more than they recall the process, and when the outcome is death, the message is clear. These casualties are, of course, absolutely tragic. But in a very backward, very unfortunate way, they could also be a force for good. Keep your Opinions sharp and informed. Get the Opinion newsletter. Sign up today."
Vaccine passports pose an equity problem,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-vaccine-passports-pose-an-equity-problem/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"The role of government should be to support, not punish. But vaccine passports will do just that – which is especially alarming, since there are so many Canadians who simply aren’t able to get the jab","['Zackary Sholem Berger', 'Andray Domise']",2021-09-02 12:00:00,"Zackary Berger is a primary care physician and bioethicist at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the Esperanza Center, both in Baltimore. Andray Domise is a Toronto-based writer. Recently, New York City became the first American city to declare that workers and customers alike will require proof of having received at least one vaccine dose, before being allowed to partake in routine activities such as dining at restaurants and exercising at gyms. Since then, Quebec, British Columbia, and now Ontario have chosen to implement ""vaccine passports"" - digital or physical proof of full immunization - to categorize which residents should and should not be able to conduct nonessential activities. Canadians are understandably anxious to see as many of their neighbors vaccinated as possible. COVID-19 cases are spiking in Canada, driven by the Delta variant, with most - but not all - occurring among the unvaccinated. But current initiatives to require vaccine passports ignore the reality of vaccine segregation, and how they could reinforce inequities in society - and how they might not actually encourage vaccination nor stop the spread of the disease. One of Dr. Berger's patients in his Baltimore clinic - a 35-year-old - was recently asked whether he'd been vaccinated against COVID-19. ""I do food prep at a restaurant, 14 hour days, six days a week,"" he replied. ""I'm not sure when I'm supposed to get time off."" He cracked a tired smile. ""And then I worry about going out, these days."" He explained that was because of COVID-19, but also because of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which has not stopped its efforts to deport the undocumented even during a global pandemic. In Canada, fear of compromising privacy has already fueled vaccine hesitancy among the undocumented, and digital vaccine passports (which require users to download an app to their phone, and to scan a QR code provided by the venue which they are visiting) has only added to their fears. More sticks, but also more carrots: How to reach Canadians who are still unvaccinated Canada needs a national vaccine passport, now. Quebec has the answer Additionally, in British Columbia, the vaccine passport requirement has been applied so stringently that even people who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons will have their freedom of movement restricted. Gabrielle Peters, a disability rights advocate in British Columbia, is among them. ""[People with disabilities] were completely ignored and now we're completely thrown under the bus because of concerns about other people,"" she said in a recent interview. ""How is it that you can make an age-based exemption, but you can't make a medical exemption?"" These people are not ideologically opposed to vaccination; they are constrained by circumstances and undermined by lack of support. How should we best respond, to support public health while also relieving the desperate circumstances of Dr. Berger's patients and those like them? Beyond medical and legal reasons, there are widespread barriers to getting vaccinated. If you can't get off work because you lack protections or just need the money, say. Or if you have to take care of kids, the bus isn't running, you're not feeling well, or you simply can't find the time to figure out how or where to get the vaccine, given everything else life has thrown at you. Then, there's also the matter of understandable mistrust in governments. A person thinking about getting vaccinated also has to trust that those organizing vaccinations have their best interest at heart. But many governments have victimized various people at various times, both in the past and to this very day. How can Black Americans place full trust in vaccinations when they're being promoted by a government with a profoundly cruel history of medical experimentation on Black communities throughout the country's history? Which Puerto Rican would not think twice about the shot, given the memory of forced sterilizations on that part of the U.S.? Who among the Indigenous people in Canada would uncritically accept any announcement from a federal government with its own history of forced sterilization and residential school programs? Technical barriers also underlie the failures that have plagued vaccine passport rollouts in Europe, as well as New York and California. In particular, the U.S. has seen technical hiccups that could have been predicted and avoided. Additionally, IBM - the developers of New York's Excelsior passport app - have already been musing about adding even more private information to the passport, including health insurance and driver's licenses. Yet, there has been no parallel effort by legislators to safeguard users' privacy with legal protections against information-sharing among third parties, or penalties for misuse. If we must have COVID-19 passports, we must also make them supportive, not punitive. They need to open doors to all the social supports that make life during a pandemic possible, and which so many have been denied: reliable, humane work; food; housing; shelter; childcare; and healthcare. The state needs to provide, not punish - and that would actually help hasten the end of COVID-19. Keep your Opinions sharp and informed. Get the Opinion newsletter. Sign up today."
Canada should rethink blanket ban on travel from South Africa,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2021/12/08/canada-should-rethink-blanket-ban-on-travel-from-south-africa.html,www.thestar.com,"‘More targeted measures to screen travellers, no matter where they come from, are likely to be more successful in containing the latest COVID threat.’",['Star Editorial Board'],2021-12-08 00:00:00,"Canada can be proud of Dr. Jody Boffa. However, the epidemiologist currently working as a research fellow at Stellenbosch University in South Africa wasn't in much of a mood to reciprocate this week. Boffa was asked during an interview with CBC Radio's Metro Morning how she felt about the reaction of Canada and other countries to South Africa's recent identification and prompt reporting of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. ""Is disgusted too harsh a word?"" Boffa asked. ""It is absolutely abhorrent to me that good science and a reputable response - a responsible sharing of information for a global pandemic - was met with ostensibly ostracizing us from the rest of the world."" Her irritation was not difficult to understand. Almost immediately upon learning of the new variant Canada and many other countries banned international travel from South Africa and other countries in the region. Even though, Boffa notes, there was no evidence that South Africa was the country of origin, or even had the most cases of the new variant. It had merely been first to report. And that's where the danger lies. ""Let me tell you, the next place to find a new big variant - if they don't already to it, and let me tell you, let's be honest, this information doesn't get published as quickly as it did here very often - nobody's going to want to come forward with that kind of information, and that's just going to cause more havoc."" The risk of creating such a chill on prompt scientific reporting by imposing extreme consequences on those who are the first to bear bad news is could have serious consequences down the road. Boffa is not alone in her view. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has called repeatedly for countries that imposed travel bans to reverse their decisions. (France, for one, has already done just that, while requiring travellers from South Africa to quarantine for 10 days.) Ramaphosa said blanket prohibitions on travel - coming on the eve of the tourism season so vital to South Africa and the region - will only damage the economies of countries that are already struggling. It seems that South Africa, which has significant expertise in COVID sequencing because of its experience treating tuberculosis and HIV, is essentially being punished for its success and forthrightness. Canada and other countries acted quickly in response to news of the Omicron variant. Some now think that hastily would be a better adverb. As the Star's Raisa Patel reported this week, Steven Hoffman, director of the Global Strategy Lab, called border closures ""good politics, not too great epidemiology."" Frustration and confusion over new testing protocols ordered after the Omicron discovery has also spiked among Canadian travellers stranded overseas or about to depart on trips abroad, Patel reports. Experts in pandemic communications have long said clarity is essential to encourage public compliance with safety protocols and any confusion of that kind undermines chances of success. There are cases of Omicron all over the world. If it's not everywhere, it soon will be. To pick out a dozen or so African countries for draconian treatment while failing to react in similar ways to their European counterparts sends a particularly disturbing message. In the name of both fairness and science, Canada and other countries should reconsider their travel bans on South Africa and neighboring countries. More targeted measures to screen travellers, no matter where they come from, are likely to be more successful in containing the latest COVID threat."

But is…",['Michelle Rempel'],2021-01-09 00:00:00,"Photo by Blair Gable / REUTERS Many Canadians believe that they will be vaccinated for COVID-19 in the next few months, and that this is the last lockdown they will have to endure. But is this true? That's the most critical question our country faces right now. I've been asking the Liberal government for months about when Canadians could reasonably expect to receive their COVID-19 vaccine. The initial responses that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his cabinet provided in the fall weren't clear. As weeks progressed and the pressure for answers grew, the Liberals finally provided one cohesive message: they had signed contracts for 400 million doses of various vaccines. On the surface, this was good news. The problem was that the Liberals wouldn't - and still won't - say when these doses would actually arrive in Canada. This has posed challenges for provincial governments whose job it is to get vaccines into the arms of Canadians. For the sake of everyone in the country, I wanted the Liberals to succeed. It was fair to give the Liberals the period between the House of Commons rising in mid-December through now to see if they would begin to make good on their assurances. I am deeply concerned that the Liberals haven't delivered, and haven't done the work to be in a position to do so anytime soon. This is because, in the last month, Canada has fallen behind other countries in COVID-19 vaccine distribution and it's not clear when we're getting the doses that we need. Canada sits at just 1.44% of our population vaccinated, well behind the pace of other nations. A month after many influencers suggested the federal government was on the right track with their vaccination plan, the evidence is clear that we're far from that. Worse, our ability to bridge this gap depends on many factors that the Liberals are not being up front about. They won't disclose Canada's precedence against other countries in the vaccine delivery schedules for the contracts they've signed, a problem highlighted by recent news reports that Canada has been placed behind Europe for doses of the Pfizer vaccine as the company corrects production capacity issues. We still don't know how much the Liberals are banking on the approval of other vaccine candidates. We also don't know if they have an alternative strategy if these approvals are delayed or aren't possible. What we do know is that we first put all our eggs in one basket with the CanSino deal until it fell apart this summer. I take no joy in bringing light to this. Canada's vaccination troubles mean that significant risk remains for vulnerable residents in Canadian long-term care facilities, health-care workers, food processing plant employees, and more. Now more than ever, the Liberals need to deliver an emergency plan that gets vaccines to Canadians. They need to resist the temptation to point fingers and shirk responsibility for political gain. While some of the responsibility for Canada's slow vaccination program certainly can be placed at the feet of provincial governments, no province can deliver vaccines they simply don't have. It's not just slow vaccine procurement that troubles me. When former Transport Minister Marc Garneau was asked about whether vaccinated persons returning to Canada from travel would still require a negative COVID-19 test, he let slip information many are glossing over. The vaccine might not stop someone from contracting or spreading the virus, it just makes the illness less severe. Even this protection may only last for less than a year. When this is considered, it's clear that Canada needs more than a plan to deal with vaccines to get through this crisis. I worry that now, even if we can up the current pace of vaccination, our slow start means we'll be vulnerable to the impact of COVID-19 for a long time to come. The Liberals need to understand that Canadians are unlikely to tolerate or be able to shoulder another year or more of the high price of rigid lockdowns. We need to employ tools like rapid testing to protect high risk populations while figuring out ways for less vulnerable populations to work and go to school. We need post-arrival testing protocols at every airport and land crossing in Canada. We need better publicly available data. We need increased capacity to test for emerging variants to the virus. A year into the pandemic, we can't allow failure, deflection and half measures to be options for the federal government. - Michelle Rempel is the Conservative Shadow Health Minister.

Opinion: Sask.-based research offers hope in unsettling times,https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-sask-based-research-offers-hope-in-unsettling-times,leaderpost.com,"Uncertain times require robust social sciences and humanities analysis, and leadership from scholars to discuss complex issues with the public.",['Baljit Singh'],2021-04-25 00:00:00,"Photo by Michelle Berg / Saskatoon StarPhoenix The COVID-19 crisis is now winding through its second year, touching every aspect of life as we are engaged in a lengthy battle to contain the spread of the virus and return to a sense of normalcy. The impact of the personal and economic sacrifices made to combat the virus will be felt for years. We've had to come to terms with threats to systems we have long taken for granted, such as our supply chains and transportation systems, and the fallout from the pandemic will reverberate for generations. In these unsettling times, Saskatchewan-based research offers hope and a source of pride, at a time when they are deeply needed. At the University of Saskatchewan, researchers at VIDO - our Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - were ready to step up in the world's time of need, thanks to our visionary leaders in 1975 supporting the establishment of a centre to understand and battle infectious diseases. Today VIDO has grown into a world-class research institute that is a leader in developing vaccines that protect human and animal health. Our researchers were the first in Canada to isolate the SARS-CoV2 virus, and the first to develop an animal model of COVID-19. In the coming months, VIDO operations will expand to include vaccine manufacturing. We have also learned that vaccines by themselves cannot offer all the answers to the crisis created by a pandemic. We need to extend to other facets of our operations the same foresight and determination that brought VIDO to Canada's fore over the past five decades. The blows from the pandemic disproportionately affected marginalized and remote Indigenous communities, and groups of newcomers, compared to other Canadians. The panic, fear and anxiety these uncertain times create require robust social sciences and humanities analysis, and leadership from scholars to discuss complex issues with the public. This engagement becomes even more critical when Canadians, most of whom for the first time have seen medical researchers develop a vaccine in real time, express some hesitancy at getting inoculated. The role of policy experts and communicators becomes crucial in reassuring people about the safety and scientific background of the process that led to what might seem a fast vaccine development. Our research in the humanities is vitally important at a time when Canadians are re-evaluating their way of life, and looking for inspiration from creative endeavours to find meaning in difficult times. Whether it is examining public policy, exploring the potential of the arts or otherwise adding to a body of scholarly work, these pursuits will help shape how we emerge from the COVID-19 crisis. Our faculty and students in the performance and creative arts play a key role in helping to bring people together via technical platforms in these times when we can't get together. Our agricultural and engineering researchers are finding innovative, green and environmentally sound ways to bring products to market. Whatever crisis the world faces next - whether it is food security, access to quality water, threats to the environment, upheavals resulting from climate change, or a proliferation of conspiracy theories that create social unrest and political chaos, we can't wait until disaster is imminent before we start looking for science-based solutions. The work needs to be ongoing. Research plays a crucial role in helping Saskatchewan not just survive and recover from the pandemic, but thrive. Researchers of all stripes, from social to biomedical sciences, do not work in isolation. The idea of them being locked away in an ivory tower is truly inaccurate. As a modern research university, USask is deeply embedded in its community and is a crucial link in the innovation ecosystem. We embrace multiple approaches to research, including Indigenous ways of knowing, land-management and living in harmony with the environment. We have vibrant partnerships with the private, public and not-for-profit sectors, including working closely with the University of Regina and Saskatchewan Polytechnic. Saskatchewanians want to know there will be jobs and opportunities for their children to remain close to home and be prosperous. A key to seeing this happen is to nourish world-class research that puts Saskatchewan at the forefront of advances in technology, and work with the wider community to integrate these technologies into our society to improve lives. Not only have we created an atmosphere where we can retain our best and brightest, but through our thriving research enterprise we are also attracting top-notch talent from around the world to build careers here. Imagine how the global economy would have collapsed and chaos would have emerged without strong science, devoted research, and evidence-based decision making. Whether it is in a lab or out in the field, USask researchers are already uncovering the solutions the world will need next.

Alberta tried to wish away the pandemic. That made it so much worse,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-alberta-tried-to-wish-away-the-pandemic-that-made-it-so-much-worse/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"Despite claiming COVID-19 had been reduced to an ‘endemic,’ Alberta’s current crisis proves that throwing away public-health measures is not yet an option",['The Editorial Board'],2021-09-17 06:00:00,"In July, Premier Jason Kenney promised Albertans the ""best summer ever."" This week, Mr. Kenny declared a public-health emergency.Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press When will the COVID-19 pandemic end? And how? For a glimpse into the future, consider the experiences of Alberta and Ontario. Let's begin in Alberta. In July, Deena Hinshaw, the province's Chief Medical Officer of Health, essentially declared the pandemic over. In her judgment, COVID-19 had been reduced to an ""endemic,"" similar to influenza. So, as of July 1, a day the province saw only 76 new cases, it ended most of its mask mandates and social-distancing measures, and said it would end widespread testing, contact tracing and mandatory isolation for close contacts of infected people as of July 28. Premier Jason Kenney promised Albertans the ""best summer ever."" He celebrated reopening earlier and more completely than other provinces. His director of issues management tweeted: ""The pandemic is ending. Accept it."" It didn't work out. This week, over the space of two days, Dr. Hinshaw issued an embarrassing mea culpa, and Mr. Kenny declared a public-health emergency. They had no choice. Alberta is now driving Canada's pandemic. It recorded 10,766 new cases over the seven days up to Wednesday - more than the combined total of new infections over the same period in Quebec and Ontario, which are home to more than five times as many people. Alberta's hospitals are swamped. On July 1, there were 165 people in hospital; by Thursday, the number had hit 896, with 222 people in intensive care. On Thursday, Dr. Verna Yiu, the head of Alberta Health Services, said the government had begun contacting other provinces about accepting patients. Part of the problem is a low vaccination rate. Just 71.5 per cent of Albertans 12 years and over have received both shots. That's lower than every province except Canada's other COVID-19 hotspot, Saskatchewan - which also reversed course this week and announced vaccine and mask mandates. It's the unvaccinated who are swamping Alberta's hospitals. Among current COVID-19 patients, 73 per cent are unvaccinated, and another 5 per cent are partially vaccinated. The numbers are even more stark among the most seriously ill: Of 746 infected Albertans in the ICU over the past four months, just 30 were fully vaccinated. In response to this self-inflicted crisis, Mr. Kenney on Wednesday announced a vaccine passport system that non-essential businesses must either use, or instead demand recent negative COVID-19 test results from their customers. Those that don't will see their business curtailed; for instance, restaurants that don't demand proof of vaccination or a negative test won't be able to offer indoor dining. Among other measures, Alberta is banning indoor private social gatherings for unvaccinated people, requiring all staff and students in Grades 4 to 12 to wear masks in school, and ordering people to work from home. This comes on top of recent measures such as the reinstatement of a mask mandate in public indoor spaces, a curfew on alcohol sales and the offer of $100 gift cards to people who get a jab. It's probably not enough. But at least it's now clear that the Kenney government made a fatal error when it told people what they - and it - wanted to believe: that even Alberta's relatively low level of vaccination was able to reduce COVID-19 to no more of a threat than the flu. Ontario took another path. It's also going through a pandemic of the unvaccinated - according to its latest data, 125 out of 138 people currently in an ICU are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. But Ontario's fourth wave has, so far, been much smaller than Alberta's. Ontario's per capita infection rate was about eight times lower than Alberta's on Tuesday, and the relative number of patients in the ICU is six times lower. Why? In part because Ontario never relented on its mask mandate for indoor spaces, and it lifted other public-health measures slowly and to a more limited degree. At the same time, to keep its vaccination rate rising, it announced a vaccine mandate more than two weeks ago, a move that helped spur an increase in the demand for jabs. The upshot? While vaccines may be the biggest and most talked about part of what's needed to get Canada into the post-pandemic era, they alone are not the cure - not until current vaccination rates go higher, and probably not until children under the age of 12 are eligible to be vaccinated. The contrast between Alberta and Ontario proves that throwing away public-health measures, notably masks, is not yet an option. Keep your Opinions sharp and informed. Get the Opinion newsletter.

Opinion: Support community services workers as they navigate pandemic,https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-community-services-workers-need-support-as-they-navigate-pandemic-helping-the-vulnerable,leaderpost.com,"""Now is the time for governments to consider community services workers' high exposure risk, treating them like health care workers.""","['Rachel Engler-Stringer', 'Kali Gartner', 'Sugandhi Del Canto']",2020-04-23 00:00:00,"Opinion: Community services workers need support as they navigate pandemic helping the vulnerable Opinion: Community services workers need support as they navigate pandemic helping the vulnerable Photo by Liam Richards / Saskatoon StarPhoenix In cities, towns, Indigenous communities and rural areas across Canada, the community-services sector has adapted program delivery during the pandemic in innovative ways. Workers at community-based organizations provide the necessities of life to people who are struggling, in new ways that reduce physical contact. These workers include the people who help families access food from a food bank or soup kitchen, the support workers who help children with disabilities and their families, those who support people struggling with addictions, trauma and mental health crises, and those who work in shelters to support people experiencing homelessness. Too often, the support from provincial/territorial governments for this work is inadequate. Staff at shelters, food banks, mental health and addictions services, and other community-based organizations have put their health and well-being at risk to continue their work often without appropriate access to personal protective equipment (PPE) or paid sick time. They have been doing so without sufficient funding to hire additional people when a staff member cannot work, like when they must self-isolate after exposure to a positive case, or if they themselves have become sick (as is being done in health and long-term care). As a result, there have been numerous community organizations that have had to close for periods of time because their staff are sick, leaving already vulnerable community members without access to food, shelter, addictions and mental health services, etc. This has happened twice now to the Saskatoon Food Bank and Learning Centre, among several others. Opinion: Community services workers need support as they navigate pandemic helping the vulnerable The workers in this sector are often poorly paid compared to their health sector counterparts. Typically, wages are low - below or barely above a living wage - and these workers are not represented by unions or professional associations that allow them to have a collective voice to do their work safely. In the Community Food and Housing and Emergency and Other Relief Fields as defined by Statistics Canada, which is a small fraction of this sector, there were more than 16,500 people employed across Canada in 2019. Women and BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and People of Colour) are over-represented in the community services sector, which has grown dramatically over the past three decades as health and social services have been off-loaded by governments of all levels to the private (community) sector. Frontline workers in health care and community service workers are in similar environments of risk, but the latter have less access to PPE, less ability to physically distance and are paid much less. They continue to do their work at considerable risk to their own and their families' health. This must change. Like looking after elders, providing critical services should not be at the expense of workers' health and safety. These workers should be paid decent wages and provided with benefits that enable them and their families to thrive. At the very minimum, now is the time for governments to consider these workers' high exposure risk, treating them like health care workers and moving them up the priority list in the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Opinion: Long-term care residents deserve time with families,https://thestarphoenix.com/opinion/letters/opinion-long-term-care-residents-deserve-time-with-families,thestarphoenix.com,"Family members have not been permitted to spend time together within LTC homes, except in limited circumstances.",[],2020-07-07 00:00:00,"It is now been more than 100 days since some Saskatchewan long-term care (LTC) residents last had face-to-face contact with their family members. In this excruciating wait, many families are suspended between hope that a new vaccine for COVID-19 will soon be available and despair at the end no one wants to think of. Photo by BRANDON HARDER / Regina Leader-Post Even in Saskatchewan, one of the provinces with the lowest level of COVID-19 spread, LTC is last on the list to reopen, at a date currently predicted to be no earlier than June 2021. There is relief in provisions for window visits at some homes, and in the recent move to allow residents to visit their family members outside, but that relief will end with the first snowfall or the next wave of community-borne infection. The rest of us, living outside LTC, have had choices about how to ride out the pandemic. Whether aged 25 or 85, and whether in congregate housing or a stand-alone residence, those of us living outside LTC have been able to shop for groceries, order takeout, visit relatives, and spend time with small groups of people. Among LTC residents, similar choices have been very seriously limited. Family members have not been permitted to spend time together within LTC homes except in limited circumstances. Many homes suspended acceptance of gifts, food, and mail - tangible signs of family members' concern and affection - at the outset of the pandemic. There are very serious risks to LTC residents during the pandemic. These risks are directly related to community transmission. Once COVID-19 begins to spread in the community, there is a much higher likelihood that it will also spread in LTC. Unless LTC becomes a completely closed system, community spread will continue to create risk. One LTC home in France avoided a COVID-19 infection during the worst period of community transmission by asking non-symptomatic staff to voluntarily live with the residents for a full month . This proved to be an extremely effective infection control strategy. Yet, even in Canada's worst-affected provinces, no one has suggested that staff members be asked to permanently relocate to LTC homes to mitigate the potentially devastating effects of COVID-19 in LTC. To mandate such an approach obviously compromises employment rights and the human right to integrity of the family. LTC residents and their families implicitly understand the importance to our society of upholding these rights and accept the associated risks."
We will never live in a COVID-19 free world again. Accept it,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-we-will-never-live-in-a-covid-19-free-world-again-accept-it/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"With Omicron, the only way forward is to get vaccinated and remain cautious – while continuing to live life as we did before",['Gary Mason'],2021-11-30 13:25:31,"People wear face masks as they walk through a market in Montreal, on Nov. 28.Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press Last month, at a White House press briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci was asked if COVID-19 would ever be vanquished. ""It is going to be very difficult - at least in the foreseeable future, and maybe ever - to truly eliminate this highly transmissible virus,"" said the chief medical adviser to the President of the United States. What Dr. Fauci had to say was likely depressing news for many. But he was only echoing what epidemiologists and infectious disease specialists have been stressing for some time: COVID-19 and its mutant iterations will be with us for some time, and possibly forever. We need to begin processing that reality. News of a worrisome COVID-19 variant, now known as Omicron, seems to have shattered the illusion many of us were operating under that we are close to the end of this thing. The fact is, it's difficult to say precisely where we are with the pandemic, except in a lot better place than we were when the virus first exploded on a world unprepared for its stealth and deadliness. We don't know enough about Omicron yet to say whether the global panic its arrival has set off is justified. It's the World Health Organization's job to warn us when these viruses are detected, but this time around, it may have unwittingly caused worldwide alarm by saying the variant posed a ""very high"" risk to the planet while at the same time admitting there was much uncertainty about its lethalness and whether vaccines offered protection against it. The WHO's strategy now seems to be: sound the alarm, find out what we're dealing with later. Then again, the WHO is in a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't situation, so I can forgive them here. Omicron, and the fear it's incited, should be something of which we make good use. It can serve as a reminder of what experts have been telling us for some time - it's pretty unlikely we will ever go back to a zero-COVID world. It's time we started to embrace the likelihood that these masks we must put on to enter restaurants and jump on buses aren't coming off this year or next. It may be something that becomes normalized. Maybe in the best-case scenario, we see COVID-19 evolve into a flu-like, seasonal phenomenon that we take precautions to avoid getting and spreading. Dr. Jeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome, a global health foundation based in London, recently told Vanity Fair magazine: ""We have to start thinking, planning and coming to grips in every way that this is now a human endemic infection and it's never going to go away."" At best, it can be mitigated with vaccines and personal health precautions in the same manner we deal with flu, which kills an average of about 3,500 people a year in Canada. You limit your chances of getting it or becoming deathly ill from it by receiving a flu shot. (In the United States, between 12,000 and 52,000 people have died annually from influenza in the last decade.) Until we get more information on Omicron, we need to reduce the level of anxiety it has spawned. There is no evidence it is some Frankenstein killer that is far deadlier than any of the strains before it. Nothing close to that. It's very likely a variant like Delta that scientists predicted would emerge until we get more of the planet vaccinated. That's a challenge in Africa, which is affected by high vaccine hesitancy and supply inequity. The best outcome from the Omicron would be if it finally convinced the vaccine-hesitant to get a jab. And for those who've only one shot to get a second. And for those who qualify for a third shot already, to get it. That is really the best thing all of us can do in the face of this new development. We need to continue to be vigilant, continue to be respectful of our neighbours, continue to be kind and continue to understand that complacency is our true enemy here. COVID-19 is not ever likely to be eradicated from the planet. It will become something that we can quite easily live with, like we do any number of other diseases. In the meantime, I am going to continue to live my life just as I was before I knew anything about Omicron. That means going to restaurants, having a pint at the pub with friends, playing golf when it's not raining sideways and working out at the gym. Shrivelling up and staying inside is not an option. Heading out with my mask and common sense every day is the only way to go. Keep your Opinions sharp and informed. Get the Opinion newsletter. Sign up today."
Federal public health leaders are silent during the election as COVID-19 fourth wave intensifies,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-federal-public-health-leaders-are-silent-during-the-election-as-covid/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"COVID-19 information, now more than ever, needs to be delivered by trustworthy, non-partisan bodies like the Public Health Agency",['André Picard'],2021-08-27 05:00:00,"Hundreds of people line up for the Peel Region Doses After Dark vaccination clinic in Mississauga, Ont. on May 15, 2021.Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press The Public Health Agency has not held a single COVID-19 briefing since the federal election was called on Aug. 15 and, according to published media reports, it has no plans to resume information sessions until after voters go to the polls on Sept. 20. This is preposterous. Guidance, not silence, is what we need right now from Dr. Theresa Tam and the PHAC team. Since early March, 2020, PHAC has held more than 250 briefings, sometimes daily. Now we're down to weekly press releases written in bureaucratese. This was understandable as the pandemic slowed. But, with cases and public anxiety rising, that doesn't cut it. Canada is in the midst of a surging fourth wave of COVID-19, and there is a lot of concern about where we could be headed. PHAC releases new COVID-19 guidance for what fully vaccinated Canadians can do Yet the last time modelling data were made public was July 30. (PHAC also continues to produce a daily epidemiological summary, but that's just data without interpretation). Again, not good enough. There are indications this will change, that briefings will resume next week, but it shouldn't take a hue and cry. We're told, by the agency and by the outgoing government, that Dr. Tam has full control over public communication and, if and when, there are public briefings. But one can't help but feel like the sticky little fingers of the Prime Minister's Office are all over this, and at least partially responsible for the silence of public officials. When you're running for re-election in a race where the launching point was ""we handled the pandemic masterfully,"" the last thing you want is bad news on the pandemic front. But politicians sticking their heads in the sand (or other dark places) is not going to make COVID-19 go away. We need modelling numbers and some analysis of what's coming down the pipe in the fall. We also need Dr. Tam's calm, reasoned voice on a host of developments like the haphazard adoption of vaccine passports, seemingly random vaccine mandates, and all-over-the-map back-to-school rules. And we need that even if it puts current or aspiring prime ministers in a spot of bother. Canada has an overly complicated division of powers when it comes to health care, but PHAC has played an important role in trying to co-ordinate provincial/territorial efforts and sometimes even doing some nudging about policy. There seems to be a lot of overly cautious tiptoeing going on because of the election campaign. This is understandable to a degree. The last thing senior government officials want is to be tangled up in a controversy or to appear partisan. But the law is clear on this: The essential work of government must continue even when candidates are out on the campaign trail, and one would be hard-pressed to imagine something more essential than public health communication during a pandemic. After the dissolution of Parliament, governments always shift into caretaker mode, with activities limited to the routine, non-controversial, urgent and in the public interest, reversible by a new government without undue cost or disruption, or agreed to by opposition parties. The work of PHAC during a pandemic is, without question, urgent, and in the public interest. Further, given that every party leader (except Liberal Justin Trudeau) has called for the PHAC briefings to resume, so there is already consensus. Mr. Trudeau, for his part, has been a bit obtuse, saying that PHAC ""will continue to make sure that Canadians are getting the information they need to stay safe."" What political leaders really need to do is commit to public health operating independently from government so they can give the public unvarnished information. One of the great fears of having an election during the pandemic was that it could accelerate partisan divisions on important issues like vaccination and masking. . The best thing politicians can do at this point is get out of the way, be quiet, and heed the advice of public health officials who, in turn, must speak up. Keep your Opinions sharp and informed.

Canadians should avoid extreme measures to coerce the unvaccinated,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-canadians-should-avoid-extreme-measures-to-coerce-the-unvaccinated/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"Extraordinary circumstances might merit exceptional policies, but there is a danger of forfeiting too many of our principles",['Robyn Urback'],2021-11-19 10:00:00,"When Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced back in the spring that police were going to randomly stop people to check if they were going out for essential purposes, many were aghastTijana Martin/The Canadian Press Canadians went through a weird period of longing last fall and winter as we watched Australia successfully implement a COVID-zero containment strategy. While we hunkered down in our homes and absorbed ever-worsening news of community spread, life in Australia carried on largely as normal, which inspired many Canadians - researchers, doctors, epidemiologists and others - to push for a COVID-zero strategy of our own. It would have been logistically impossible to replicate what Australia had done, of course, namely because Canada shares a massive land border with the United States and it relies on daily shipments of goods across that border to keep the country running. But beyond the technical challenges, it was fascinating to observe the apparent nonchalance COVID-zero advocates had for the extreme and rather oppressive methods Australia used to keep COVID-19 at bay. Australian citizens abroad were not permitted to return to their own country as authorities maintained a strict quota system that only allowed a limited number of people to fly in each week. In an effort to contain an outbreak in Melbourne, thousands of people in nine public-housing buildings were essentially locked in their homes for five days - their buildings surrounded by police - without sufficient prior warning to pick up food and other essentials. During one lockdown in South Australia in November, people were not even permitted to take their dogs out on walks. Extraordinary circumstances might merit exceptional policies, but there is a danger in yielding so much to the notion that the ends justify the means that fundamental principles are lost in the process. Take the seeming endorsement some Canadians have expressed recently for the policy soon to be adopted by Singapore, whereby those who are ""unvaccinated by choice"" will not have their medical bills for COVID-19 treatment covered by the government (though private insurers may still cover the cost). Singapore's vaccination rate is extremely high - roughly 85 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated - but its health care system is nevertheless feeling the strain of unvaccinated cases ending up in hospital. So in an effort to encourage its remaining holdouts to receive the shot, Singapore will begin charging unvaccinated COVID-19 patients as of Dec. 8. Vaccinated Canadians watching from across the North Pacific might hope, in vain, that authorities here might adopt something similar. But our universal health care system does not discriminate based on personal behaviour - everyone gets the same treatment (theoretically, that is) whether they smoke cigarettes, or wear their seatbelt, or get injured while committing a crime, or choose to take the medicine as prescribed by their doctors. Some might argue that a pandemic is a good reason to temporarily change the rules, but to abandon one of the fundamental tenets of our health care system now is to create a precedent to abandon it during any future episodes of strain. The same argument holds against adopting an extreme lockdown of the unvaccinated akin to what has recently been implemented in Austria. Austria is in a very different situation from Singapore - its vaccination numbers are low (roughly 65 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated), and new daily infections have recently reached record highs. In response, Austria has instituted a nationwide lockdown whereby those who are unvaccinated may only leave home for limited reasons, including work, school and to buy food. Police are permitted to conduct spot checks and will fine those who cannot offer proof of vaccination. When Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced back in the spring that police were going to randomly stop people to check if they were going out for ""essential"" purposes, many were aghast - and rightfully so (the Premier walked back the announcement not 24 hours later). To allow police to stop and question anyone, at any time, is to grant police unchecked and unjustified power (which tends to negatively effect minority communities), and would constitute a major infringement on individual rights in a free society. And while those who oppose vaccine mandates might argue that we are already living in something of a police state, I'd posit that there is a pretty major difference between having to show a QR code to eat a plate of carbonara in a Boston Pizza, and being stopped randomly by police on the street to see if you have left your home for an unsanctioned reason. The frustration with those who continue to refuse vaccination and extend the duration of this pandemic is real. But the answer is not to resort to such coercive, anti-democratic measures that we lose sight of - and compromise on - our most basic fundamental principles. Canada has used both carrots and sticks to get people to follow public-health instructions. While other countries might use tasers, it's not something we should hope to emulate.

Toronto’s creative campaign shows it’s heroic to get vaccinated,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2021/11/15/torontos-creative-campaign-shows-its-heroic-to-get-vaccinated.html,www.thestar.com,"‘Light-heartedness, even happiness. That should be the response to Team Toronto Kids, the city’s rollout plan to vaccinate children between 5 and 11 a...",['Star Editorial Board'],2021-11-15 00:00:00,"To heave a sigh of relief: to let out a deep breath, to experience light-heartedness, even happiness. That should be the collective response to Team Toronto Kids, the city's announced rollout plan to vaccinate children between the ages of 5 and 11 against COVID-19. We can just hear exhausted and often defeated parents in the playground giving thanks for a strategy that will help ensure that children stay well and that schools stay protected and open. Playdates! Parents have been over-burdened. The ceaseless home monitoring for symptoms. The never-ending school board directives to keep single-symptom children at home, in isolation, even with the mildest of coughs. The additional guidance to keep the child at home if any other household member experiences a single symptom. And on and on. The anxiety of a child falling ill. The anxiety of a child spreading the virus to others. All that without even addressing the potentially crushing effects of a fractured education and the social dislocation that results when school is no longer an anchor in a young one's life. But as the Public Health Agency of Canada recently made clear, children under the age of 12 now account for 20 per cent of all daily cases. Now Toronto health officials have set their sights on vaccinating the more than 200,000 children who fall within the 5-to-11 age band, what will be the largest vaccination drive in the city's history. The implementation plan should begin by month's end as soon as Health Canada gives the green light to the administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Smartly, the city has taken a comprehensive and creative approach by laying out, in advance, details of just how the rollout will work. School-based clinics, fixed-site clinics, hospital and community-based clinics: the delivery system will be complemented by information sessions and an advertising campaign portraying vaccine-taking kids as superheroes. Live music! Prizes! Hero selfies! Councillor Joe Cressy says the broad-based plan is directed at breaking down every barrier and building every bridge to vaccination. Some useful background: the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized use of the Pfizer vaccine in 5 to 11-year-olds in late October after a safety study of more than 3,000 children found no serious side effects and an efficacy rate of nearly 91 per cent in preventing COVID-19 in the study group. Children have been taking the jab since the beginning of this month. The dose delivered is a third of that given to adults, and is administered in two shots, three weeks apart, using smaller needles specifically designed for small arms. Side effects? Children might experience redness and/or swelling at the injection site. Headaches, chills and fever could follow. Here's where parents and caregivers come in. As the city awaits the green light to start administering doses, get ready to talk to the kids. As all the experts say, be honest. Will it hurt? The answer to that question is not ""No."" Is it heroic to get the jab? The answer to that is ""Yes."" In truth, the city's superhero advertising idea is not original. Pfizer filmed a number of its young volunteers who had participated in its clinical trial twirling capes and wearing masks and jumping off couches and flexing non-existent muscles. Superheroes fight the coronavirus. Superheroes are courageous. Superheroes save people. ""The most important heroes are those who help others,"" says one. ""You're helping the whole entire world,"" says another. It's pretty adorable. That's the mood the city hopes to tap into to comfort and encourage today's kids. With luck the rollout will help overcome needle phobia for tomorrow's adults."
We need a strategy to avert vaccine inequity in racialized children,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2021/12/06/we-need-a-strategy-to-avert-vaccine-inequity-in-racialized-children.html,www.thestar.com,"Unless we take decisive action, the current disparities in COVID rates and impacts for racialized groups will also be seen in childhood immunization.",['Kwame Mckenzie'],2021-12-06 00:00:00,"COVID-19 vaccinations for children aged five to 11 add an extra layer to our pandemic strategy. Unfortunately, it will increase unfairness in the impacts of the virus - unless we develop specific and properly funded strategies for vaccinating racialized youth. Ontario has had one of the best pandemic responses in the world. Our death rate from COVID is three times lower than that of the U.K. and U.S., and we have outperformed most of Europe. But some parts of our population have been hit worse than others, and our response has not always been equitable. Racialized groups in Ontario have higher rates of infection, hospitalization, ICU admission and death from COVID than white groups. Despite being harder hit, many racialized populations are less likely to be vaccinated. In particular, Black people in Ontario are twice as likely to be unvaccinated as the white population. Unless we take decisive action, the current disparities in COVID rates, impacts and vaccination for racialized groups will also be seen in childhood immunization. There is some good news, however: we have seen that it is possible to decrease pandemic inequity when we try. Toronto used sociodemographic data it collected to identify hot spots and groups at risk. It worked with communities to co-create public health strategies that met their needs. These included pop-up testing sites, free places to isolate, increased buses to decrease crowding, and action on eviction protection and food security. Between June and December 2020, the combined efforts of community groups and community health centres, the Toronto region of Ontario Health and the City of Toronto brought rates of COVID-19 in the Black population down from nine times that of the white population to two times. Rates in the Latin-origin population decreased from 11 times to five times that of the white population. The strategy also worked for other racialized groups, with inequities in COVID-19 impacts decreasing in South Asian, South East Asian and Arab, Middle Eastern and West Asian origin groups. This community-based approach was transferred to Ontario's vaccine roll-out. Community health organizations developed a vaccination playbook to build community capacity and increase the ability of public health and hospitals to reach impacted groups. The province temporarily increased supply of vaccines to hardest hit areas, and supported a community ambassador program. Groups like the Black Physicians' Association of Ontario and the Black Health Alliance worked with public health and hospitals to set up community-based vaccination clinics, significantly increasing vaccine uptake. Without these efforts, the differences between vaccination rates for racialized groups and the white population would be even greater than they are. But, despite the fact they have proved effective, these efforts have been piecemeal, underfunded and too often reliant on volunteers. We need to learn from our COVID-19 successes and failures. The strategies that worked to decrease inequities in COVID-19 impacts and vaccination rates could ensure that racialized children get the best possible chance of vaccination. We need to use them. We urgently need an appropriately funded vaccination strategy for kids aged five to 11 that will ensure equity, and we specifically need a strategy for the Black population. The strategy would work with communities to identify the best ways to maximize the chance of vaccination. It would build on and support existing community resources and experts in communities. It would increase funding to community organizations and the province's community ambassadors tactic, and it would challenge public health units to develop networks and contacts so they can properly meet the needs of the populations they serve. Crucially, it would require data collection, set targets and require transparent reporting, so we all know that our public health efforts are reaching the people they should. Throughout the pandemic, we have relied on racialized populations as the essential workers who take risks to keep everyone safe. It is only fair that when we develop the vaccination response for children, we do everything we can to keep these valuable communities safe. The vaccination efforts for kids will demand a slow and steady approach, and this requires sustainable investments that ensure racialized children are not left behind."
Boosters will help in our war of attrition against COVID. But Ontario should prepare for a long slog,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/2021/11/10/boosters-will-help-in-our-war-of-attrition-against-covid-but-ontario-should-prepare-for-a-long-slog.html,www.thestar.com,"More than anything, boosters are a reminder of the obvious: vaccines still work, the pandemic isn’t over, and governments can still screw this up.",['Bruce Arthur'],2021-11-10 00:00:00,"So, it's a third shot. Hopefully, anyway. On Tuesday, Health Canada gave its blessing to a third-shot booster of Pfizer for Canadians 18 or older, six months after a second shot, to counter the eventual waning immunity of a two-shot regimen. It doesn't have to happen yet, because vaccines are still doing the job. But sooner or later, the provinces should and will enact it. After all, it was two and a half weeks ago that Ontario announced its reopening plan, in which nightclubs, strip clubs, sex clubs and bathhouses regain full capacity on Monday, with cases already starting to rise and a government saying it will stay the course. Meanwhile, Ontario envisioned a possible elimination of vaccine passports in restaurants, bars and other establishments by Jan. 17, in high-risk settings by Feb. 7, and finally a lifting of masking and vaccine passports altogether by March 28. But third-shot boosters are necessary because in other jurisdictions there has been evidence of an erosion of efficacy after six to eight months. Which means the idea of being fully vaccinated in the first place will be a rolling target in a province that still doesn't have enough people vaccinated with a second dose, and seems disinclined to do very much to push the number along. Maybe if you ditch passports the definition of fully vaccinated won't matter. But those end dates feel even more aspirational today. ""I think there's a lot of information out there, some of which is conflicting - it's kind of quite complicated,"" says Dr. Jeff Kwong, an epidemiologist and a senior public health scientist at ICES, also known as the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Science. ""The short story is this: it appears that there's waning against infection, but not so (much) waning against hospitalization or death. So it's kind of good news that the vaccines are still very effective against severe outcomes: we've been doing this for eight months and it's still pretty strong. ""The tricky thing is that if there's waning against infection, then that means there's risk of transmission, and the more infection begets more transmission, and you're going to see some severe outcomes."" Indeed, as immunity wanes the virus will have a better chance to not only infect and in rare cases severely sicken vaccinated individuals, but it will have more avenues to Ontario's still-substantial unvaccinated population. Even once 90 per cent of individuals over the age of 12 are vaccinated, that would leave almost 1.3 million unvaccinated Ontarians. ""Those people are definitely at risk, but the reason that things up until the last couple days have been stable is because of all the other measures we have: the masks, other restrictions, people working from home, stuff like that,"" says Kwong. ""People haven't gone back to their pre-COVID days as far as number of contacts and things like that. So I think that has kept the lid on things getting out of control. ""But what worries me is (with enough erosion of protection) and if we get rid of all our masks and everything, we're going to see what they saw in Israel and the U.S. and everywhere else where they have pretty high vaccination rates but still have pretty big surges, and that's why they've done their boosters. In their cases, the boosters are critical if you're only relying on vaccines."" It's important to just recognize all of this for what it is. Boosters do not mean an ongoing attempt by the government to control your lives so much as perhaps save your life, and that shouldn't be so confusing. Boosters don't mean vaccines don't work: boosters are HOW they work, and there are plenty of existing vaccines which come in three-shot regimens, like the HPV virus, which has reduced one cancer by 87 per cent, or hepatitis B. And we might need more boosters in future because as it turns out, COVID-19 is a gigantic, dangerous, society-derailing pain in the ass, the largest mass casualty event on a global scale since the Second World War, and you know what you do about that if you're an adult? Get a safe, free shot every year to protect yourself and others, if that's what it takes. And it might. It's a challenge. That's all. Ontario has already begun targeted boosters to those over 70; who had double doses of AstraZeneca or one dose of Johnson & Johnson,; First Nations, Metis or Inuit and their household members; and health-care workers or long-term-care caregivers. If you fit that category and had your second dose 168 days ago, you can get a third. Population-wide eligibility will also mean the hard work of vaccination happening again. The province's original vaccine task force was disbanded in August, and the quiet replacement doesn't sound like it has found its feet yet. This time public health units have the advantage of existing infrastructure - this time it will be heavily based in pharmacies, family doctors and some city clinics - and an existing list of those who have been vaccinated, and who can be contacted. The downside is the slog. Public health officials report some staff have been worn down by anti-vaxxers or even the vaccine-hesitant; the sense of mission urgency has been replaced at least in part by a sense of work. It's just the routine now, the work. The work of education and outreach at a community level will hopefully continue. But this is the test of the virus, which doesn't get tired. The idea of vaccine mandates expiring while re-vaccination is effectively occurring would be madness; the idea of a coherent road map by date is probably fantasy. What Ontario needs is a durable architecture, and something beyond election-year leadership. The pandemic is a complex, ever-changing challenge, and it can be handled. But there's real work left to do."
Anti-vaxxers hit rock bottom by trying to intimidate kids and parents,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2021/12/01/anti-vaxxers-hit-rock-bottom-by-trying-to-intimidate-kids-and-parents.html,www.thestar.com,‘Last weekend anti-vaccine demonstrators gathered outside a clinic in North Bay and tried to intimidate a mother taking her seven-year-old son to get ...,['Star Editorial Board'],2021-12-01 00:00:00,"It's hard to believe that hard-core anti-vaxxers could fall any lower than besieging hospitals and harassing health-care workers. But some of them have indeed found an even uglier tactic in their campaign to scare people away from getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Last weekend anti-vaccine demonstrators gathered outside a clinic in North Bay called One Kids Place and tried to intimidate a mother taking her 7-year-old son to get his first shot. Abby Blaszczyk says she had to endure a torrent of abuse as she escorted her son Nolan, who had just become eligible for a COVID vaccine. ""They told me I … was murdering my son, I was committing genocide, stuff like that,"" she told CBC News. ""And then, just misinformation about the vaccine itself."" Blaszczyk says other parents faced similar harassment. And they're not alone: in Windsor last week anti-vaxxers picketed another clinic that was offering vaccines to kids between 5 and 11. They carried signs with slogans like, ""It's not a vaccine. It's a bioweapon."" We need as many kids as possible to get vaccinated as quickly as possible, and clinics offering shots should be welcoming spaces for them and their parents. Intimidating children in the name of pushing an anti-vax agenda is both infuriating and contemptible. Police are now investigating the North Bay incident, and they should redouble their efforts to prevent this kind of activity. Vaccine clinics, along with other institutions, such as hospitals and schools, should be off-limits for such protests. If anti-vaxxers want to exercise their freedom to demonstrate, they should go to places like Queen's Park. In North Bay, Mayor Al McDonald told them to go to city hall. ""But there's no need to harass or shout obscenities at grandparents or parents or the families that are there just trying to do what's best for their kids,"" he added. The Ontario government could go a step further, and formally declare hospitals, schools and similar places out of bounds for anti-vaccine harassment. Both the provincial New Democrats and Liberals have called on the Ford government to pass legislation that would create so-called safety zones around schools and hospitals to protect health workers and patients from abuse. ""Health-care workers shouldn't be worried about walking a gauntlet of hate and vitriol on their way into work,"" NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said in October, and the same principle applies to parents and kids at vaccine clinics. The British Columbia government has introduced just such legislation in that province. And last week the federal government introduced Bill C-3, which would create new criminal sanctions for anyone who tries to intimidate health care workers or patients trying to access some medical services, including COVID vaccinations. The Ford government says such legislation isn't necessary; it argues there are already laws on the books forbidding harassment directed at health-care workers and now at kids and parents. A new law, however, would send a strong signal that such behaviour is unacceptable. Just as important would be more active enforcement of those existing laws against anyone who uses intimidation as a weapon in their campaign against vaccines. In North Bay, Abby Blaszczyk said there was no security or police presence when she and her son were at the One Kids Place clinic. But police there now say they'll ramp up their presence, ""and if the protest escalates to criminal behaviour, we will not hesitate to take enforcement action."" That's good to hear, but it's tragic that such a statement is needed at all. For heaven's sake, leave the kids alone."
"This time, Doug Ford’s wishful thinking on relaxing COVID restrictions is tempered by an old Ontario virtue - caution",https://www.thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/2021/10/22/this-time-doug-fords-wishful-thinking-on-relaxing-covid-restrictions-is-tempered-by-an-old-ontario-virtue-caution.html,www.thestar.com,"It had all the hallmarks of this government, sure — a reluctance to tackle anti-vaxxers, a sort of wishcasting, a tilt towards the economy, election a...",['Bruce Arthur'],2021-10-22 00:00:00,"In Ontario, this is about as good as it gets. Masks stay, not everything opens at once, and the government didn't inexplicably close the playgrounds. There is good reason to be skeptical of this province on anything pandemic-related; they have, as people say, a history. But the reopening plan announced by the province Friday afternoon was something closer to cautious. It had all the hallmarks of this government, sure - a reluctance to tackle anti-vaxxers, a sort of wishcasting, a tilt towards the economy, election angling. And weather alone might push Ontario into case growth, soon enough. But it's not as bad as it's been in previous waves. That counts as progress. ""I think we'll see a substantial rise in cases,"" said Dr. Andrew Morris, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Toronto, the medical director of the Antimicrobial Stewardship Program at Sinai-University Health Network, and a member of the province's independent volunteer science table. ""I hope I'm wrong. But to their credit, they're not opening up like crazy, and they are delaying some degree of opening up."" The basics are that capacity limits are gone in restaurants, gyms and casinos on Monday, as well as other businesses who agree to enforce the vaccine passport system; riskier venues like nightclubs are fully open Nov. 15. Then comes the wishing: a Jan. 17 date to consider whether to lift capacity limits where a vaccine card isn't required, Feb. 7 to see whether the vaccine passport is eliminated in high-risk settings, and March 28 to consider lifting both masking and vaccine passport requirements. It's nonsense to plan that far ahead in a pandemic - as Morris says, ""It's not like COVID follows a calendar"" - but worse, the government may be actively undermining the measures that could most effectively end this pandemic. Vaccine mandates are just beginning to spread, and giving finish lines for proof of vaccine is nothing but a carrot for those who refuse to be vaccinated. Vaccination is moving so slowly now; last week Ontario managed a 0.8 per cent rise in fully vaccinated individuals. The last mile is the hardest. ""I'm just hoping … we will be over 90 per cent by then, just, just keep getting vaccinated, you know? But we can't forever, for the end of time, just ignore the people that aren't vaccinated,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""They're part of Ontario. Again, we'll be, I'll be up here preaching every single day to get vaccinated, but there has to be a time that everyone eventually comes together, our vaccination rate is high enough, and our ICUs are in good shape. So that's going to be the determining factor."" The premier has shown sympathy to anti-vaxxers all the way along, for whatever reason. Almost 84 per cent of eligible Ontarians are fully vaccinated; that leaves a long way to go before the desired 90 per cent threshold, especially once five-to-11-year-olds become eligible, too. Giving potential expiration dates for the unvaccinated just seems like an incentive. ""The government is kind of stuck, because it's about 10-13 per cent of the adult population where they feel you can't get them immunized unless you tie them down,"" says Morris. ""And a proportion of them are going to end up in the ICU. So what do you do? You can't hold all of society hostage because of that number. ""So either you let it rip, and if you let it rip too soon you can have an Eastern Europe scenario where you overwhelm your hospitals and have to go back into lockdown. Or you say, we're going to take our time, hopefully, slowly, and the unvaccinated will be infected little by little, and it won't impact our health system so much. ""And it's not an unreasonable strategy, because we don't really have a solution. We know that 80 to 90 per cent of hospital beds are occupied by unvaccinated people, and the ICU is going to be the same, and the deaths are going to be the same. So what possibly can you do about that? You just hope our ICU can handle the capacity."" Maybe it can. Ontario's independent volunteer science table delivered its latest round of modelling earlier in the day, and projected hospitalization could remain stable even with a rise in contacts to pre-pandemic level, thanks to vaccination. The table also recommended more robust vaccination infrastructure for five-to-11-year-olds, and continued vaccine certificates; you can add more outreach and education to that, too. Open up too much too fast and you look like Denmark, which has a higher vaccination rate, no masks, and a fourth wave. Open it up carefully and Ontario may be able to burble along. The second path sounds better, right? ""We will see, we will find out,"" said Dr. Peter Juni, the scientific director of the science table. ""First of all, the most important part is to be able to disentangle the effects of these different moves that we're doing, and we can do that. So something we're discussing now can be obsolete in three weeks. I believe it will be the data speaking. ""(Chief medical officer of health Dr.) Kieran Moore said clearly, that is when we'll look at the data; it is not when it will be done. It's a road map. If the data does look good, we move; if it doesn't, we wait."" Let's hope Moore is steering the ship, and that he don't have to intervene, but that he can if he has to. If the second wave, the third wave, the tragedies of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and next year's election haven't scared Ontario's goofball gang straight, then maybe nothing will. If you want to be optimistic we can see the future, or at least a future. Ontario's case counts are manageable, for the moment. This plan is far from crazy, and Moore isn't Dr. David Williams. The initial FDA report on Pfizer vaccine for five-to-11-year-olds showed almost no worrisome safety indicators, and a high level of efficacy. That vaccine data is in front of Canadian regulators right now. The virus isn't done with this fool species yet. But this pandemic will end, eventually; we just don't know exactly when, or exactly how. We can, however, hope. Read more about:"
"Ontario will expand vaccine booster eligibility to anyone 50 and up. By our standards, this is lightning-fast",https://www.thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/2021/12/01/ontario-will-expand-vaccine-booster-eligibility-to-anyone-50-and-up.html,www.thestar.com,The expected opening date is mid-December but could move up if the COVID-19 vaccination rate remains slow.,['Bruce Arthur'],2021-12-01 00:00:00,"More boosters are coming, and not a moment too soon. As the world waits to learn more about the Omicron variant, two sources confirm that Thursday, Ontario will announce an expansion of eligibility on third-shot boosters to anybody 50 and up, with an expected opening date in mid-December. It may be late; it doesn't solve every problem, because nothing does. But it's a welcome move. By Ontario's standards, this counts as lightning-fast. Omicron's detection was announced by the World Health Organization last Friday; for Ontario to announce a significant and helpful policy change within a week, even if the policy itself is overdue, was something like agility. But even without Omicron, the Delta variant was already ransacking several regions of the province, and Ontario as a whole has been in exponential growth for several weeks; in Europe, soaring COVID-19 case counts were followed by increased hospitalizations, too, and there are approximately 350,000 unvaccinated people over the age of 50 in Ontario. Data from other countries has showed immunity conferred by two doses of a vaccine erodes around the six-month mark, though it can be longer depending on the interval between shots. Ontario data was just starting to show waning in the 50-plus category; the province's threshold for a third shot is 168 days after the second one, and that will presumably apply here. One source said Ontario will likely accelerate access to third-shot boosters for the rest of the population, too: at present, that would likely not occur until the new year. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization is expected to announce expanded guidance on boosters Friday. It won't be easy, because the province was not planning on this. Two sources said an actual date for 50-plus shots remains fluid - if daily new vaccinations remain slow it could open more capacity in the immunization system, and a planned date of Dec. 13 could be moved up. There are approximately four million Ontarians between the ages of 50 and 69; it takes about a week after a third dose to boost immunity, but most eligible citizens will not be boosted in time for immunity to rise before, say, Christmas. The virus, again, does not own a calendar. It may be difficult. The immunization system has already been denuded by doctors going back to their practices, burnout and lack of staff at the public health level, and the closure of several mass vaccination centres. The province has turned to pharmacies to fill the gap - family doctors don't seem to be a big part of the plan - but the province has also opened vaccinations to five-to-11-year-olds, and over 100,000 awesome eligible children have received their first shot. Premier Doug Ford has done very little to push vaccination beyond a mandate for long-term care, and has barely tweeted about vaccination in over a month. But he pushed for vaccination Wednesday, just a little. ""If you haven't already done so, please get vaccinated today,"" said Ford while announcing a previously announced hospital in Mississauga. ""If you put off your second dose, please get your second dose. And if you're eligible for your third dose, book your booster appointment as soon as you're able to."" Ontario had already opened up third-shot boosters to those over 70, to health-care workers, to Indigenous, Metis and Inuit and their household members, and to those who got two shots of the AstraZeneca vaccine, or one dose of Johnson & Johnson. Ontario has approximately four million doses in freezers, daily new vaccinations remain limited, and third doses have not moved quickly in the 70-plus population. There remain concerns that some mutations in the Omicron variant could result in vaccine evasion, though at a briefing Wednesday, WHO chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan said that with the proviso that the data is still in its preliminary stages, ""We think vaccines will still protect against severe disease, as they have against the other variants."" We live in hope. At the same briefing, COVID technical lead Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove cautioned that the question of increased transmissibility would be answered in the coming days, and the severity of disease has not been firmly established. But she also said, ""Everything we can do for Delta, which is dominant worldwide, needs to be applied and strengthened for Omicron."" Exactly, and vaccines top the list. Hopefully the news on Omicron will be positive, but this pandemic remains a societal challenge, every day, and a personal one, too. A powerful public information campaign on boosters would be welcome. A more durable infrastructure on vaccine passports, mandates and delivery may be a must. We can do better to protect people. But the boosters are coming, and if you are eligible, it is worth finding yourself an appointment and protecting yourself."
Omicron is now in Toronto schools.

In September 2018, the premier tweeted ""Everything is FREE!"" alongside a virtual invitation to Ford Fest, the Ford family's legendary mass offering of complimentary BBQ meats. I attended Ford Fest a few years prior, where I enjoyed not one but two free hot dogs. All of this is to say that clearly it's in Doug Ford's nature to dole out freebies to constituents in a totally inappropriate context. Why then is the premier withholding freebies when the context couldn't be more appropriate? Premier: hot dogs and cash are a wonderful combination. But in this winter of Omicron, Ontarians need a different one. We need free and easy access to rapid antigen tests that we can administer at home. This is the freebie you must dole out right now. This is the freebie you should have doled out yesterday. On Monday, Toronto Public Health announced it was investigating Toronto's first school case of the Omicron variant detected at an elementary school in Scarborough. Cases in general are trending upward. The holidays are approaching. Doctors warn that early next year, the provincial health care system will likely be under even more strain than it is now. We had hoped vaccines would render them unnecessary but it appears it's time, once again, to dust off the foreboding pandemic metaphors. We are headed in the wrong direction. We must use every tool in our tool box to reverse course. Rapid tests are a great tool. Not only do they have a strong accuracy rate when used correctly, they are often painless (a major plus for today's children who fear the PCR swab). Are they a perfect substitute for PCR lab tests? No. But they are, to borrow the provincial government's favourite COVID-ism, a legitimate ""added layer of protection."" ""Rapid testing is an important tool in our efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep our residents safe,"" says the city's busiest person, Toronto Board of Health chair Joe Cressy. ""It's one tool, but an important one. The more widely available and accessible testing is, especially during the holiday season as people gather together, the better."" Unfortunately they aren't widely available. What they are (unless you're a business owner who meets the province's criteria) is expensive - 40 bucks a pop at a pharmacy. The provincial government has promised to send schoolchildren home with a box of five rapid antigen tests each for the winter holidays. But why stop there? Ontario has several million tests sitting around collecting dust. The province should dole out every last one of them before Christmas. What exactly is the premier waiting for? Even more health-care professionals to declare he needs to move fast on this? Social media is on fire (as usual) with health-care voices demanding Ontario ""release the rapid antigen tests."" Currently a petition penned by Ontario ICU nurse Birgit Umaigba is being shared widely urging Ford to ""provide free COVID-19 rapid antigen tests to every household in Ontario."" ""Little doubt Omicron will become the next dominant variant,"" Toronto infectious disease specialist Abdu Sharkawy tweeted on Tuesday morning. ""To prevent a 5th wave of morbidity & mortality, more restrictions, school closures, rapid tests should be made widely accessible. Simple, cost-effective tool."" A simple cost-effective tool for a lucky few. As it tends to go in this godforsaken pandemic, two classes of Ontarians are emerging. Those who can afford to shell out hundreds of dollars to keep their pantries stocked with rapid antigen tests and those who can't. We should be entering a holiday season in which home testing is free for everyone. Instead, Ontarians who likely need rapid tests the least are buying them in droves in order to test their loved ones prior to holiday parties hosted in affluent neighbourhoods with high vaccine uptake. Meanwhile those who need the tests the most - people in low-income communities with low vaccine uptake - are left hoping for the best. New variant. Same old story. Read more about:"
Third COVID-19 shots must be offered to immunocompromised Canadians,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-third-covid-19-shots-must-be-offered-to-immunocompromised-canadians/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"So far, Ontario is the only province to have authorized additional doses for people with weakened immune systems",['Kristen Hopewell'],2021-08-30 07:00:00,"A temporary COVID-19 vaccination clinic set up near one of the entrances to Stade Saputo before the match between the Toronto FC and the CF Montreal in Montreal on Aug. 27.Eric Bolte/USA TODAY Sports via Reuters Kristen Hopewell is the Canada research chair in global policy in the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs at the University of British Columbia. As the number of COVID-19 cases continued to rise in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration announced it was taking action to bolster protection for people whose weakened immune systems leave them acutely vulnerable to the coronavirus. Earlier this month, it authorized extra doses of vaccines for the immunocompromised. This is a move that will save countless lives. U.S. health officials later said they were considering booster shots for all Americans in the fall. Canadian health care leaders, however, continue to deny additional doses to the immunocompromised. This is putting our most vulnerable citizens in danger. About 3 per cent of Canadians - more than a million people - are immunocompromised. They include transplant recipients, as well as patients with cancer, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases that damage the immune system. People with compromised immune systems are far more likely to become seriously ill, require hospitalization or die from COVID-19 than the rest of the population - in fact, they are 10 times as likely to die from the disease. There is also evidence they are more likely to transmit the virus to family members, friends and health care workers and can become hosts for new and more dangerous variants. This small but highly vulnerable group has been left behind by Canada's vaccination strategy. So far, Ontario is the only province to have authorized third doses for people with compromised immune systems. For most Canadians, two doses provide a high degree of protection against severe illness and death from COVID-19. But that is not the case for the immunocompromised. The coronavirus vaccines work by stimulating our immune systems to produce disease-fighting antibodies. But people with compromised immune systems have weaker responses to the vaccines. As many as 80 per cent of immunocompromised people produced no detectable antibody response to the standard two doses of the coronavirus vaccine, according to data compiled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And among those who do produce an immune response, antibody levels can be more than 100 times lower than in the general population. The consequences are dire: Immunocompromised people account for almost half of all hospitalized COVID-19 ""breakthrough"" cases observed in the U.S. and Israel. While regions across Canada reopen and loosen pandemic restrictions, people with fragile immune systems remain in grave danger. There is hope, however. Recent studies - including one by researchers at the University Health Network in Toronto - have shown that, for many immunocompromised people, a third dose of a coronavirus vaccine dramatically improves their antibody response. The World Health Organization has called for a temporary moratorium on ""booster"" shots, citing the growing disparity in vaccination rates between rich and poor countries. But WHO officials do not necessarily oppose additional doses for specific populations not protected by the standard two-dose regimen. For the immunocompromised, a third dose is not a booster - it's an attempt to provide an adequate level of primary immunization for people who have failed to respond fully or at all to previous shots. Given the rapid spread of the highly contagious Delta variant, ensuring an adequate level of immunization among the immunocompromised takes on far greater urgency. In the U.S., third shots will begin immediately for these high-risk groups. It joins a growing list of countries, including France, Germany, Sweden, the U.K. and Israel, providing additional doses for the immunocompromised. For such vulnerable people, access to a third shot may mean the difference between life and death. Canadian health care leaders urgently need to authorize additional doses of COVID-19 vaccines for the immunocompromised. Keep your Opinions sharp and informed. Get the Opinion newsletter.

While more vaccine supply continues to be made available, the latest COVID-19 variants are more contagious than ever. That is why every bit we can do to curb the virus in our communities counts. Adding rapid antigen testing to the arsenal of protections, especially for small- and medium-sized businesses (SMEs), and particularly in regions with hot spots, is one more important step towards a safe reopening and our economic recovery. OPINION: Rapid testing provides additional layer to keep communities safe Rapid testing, in combination with public health measures and vaccinations, are important tools to protect Canadians and help limit the spread of COVID-19. This is particularly important as we wait for vaccinations to rollout across the country. With at least one in three COVID-19 infections being asymptomatic, rapid testing is key to identifying people who are unknowingly spreading the virus with no symptoms. Screening measures can help reduce the risk of outbreaks, identify and isolate cases, and limit the spread in workplaces and the broader community. On May 7, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, in partnership with the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, and Ontario and Canadian governments, launched the COVID-19 Rapid Screening Initiative. Through this initiative, participating chambers of commerce and boards of trade will roll out free rapid tests to small- and medium-sized businesses in communities across Canada. The Initiative was first successfully piloted in the Waterloo Region by the Greater Kitchener Waterloo and Cambridge Chambers of Commerce in partnership with Communitech, the Government of Ontario, and Government of Canada. We are proud that many of our member chambers of commerce and boards of trade will be offering this program. Ontario is the first province to roll this program out through the Ontario Chamber of Commerce in coordination with the Ontario Chamber Network. Over 850,000 rapid tests will be going out to communities across Ontario with more than 40 chambers participating in rolling this program out. In the coming weeks and months, more chambers will be participating as the initiative is rolled out across the country through the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in coordination with provincial and territorial chambers of commerce and boards of trade. The goal of the program is to identify asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 in the workplace that might otherwise be missed, helping to curb the spread in the workplace, at home and around the community. Businesses (including non-chamber members) with 150 employees or fewer can order tests through their local participating chamber. There is no one way to beat the pandemic. We must all do our part to help slow the spread and save lives. With the virus continuing to spread well into the third wave across the country, having layers of protection to ensure the safety of Canadians is critical. By providing testing and screening tools to workplaces, organizations will have another layer to keep their employees and, by extension, their communities safe. Chambers of commerce and boards of trade from across the country have provided critical support during the entire pandemic to their local businesses and communities and are extremely proud to support this important initiative. - Perrin Beatty is President and Chief Executive Officer of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and Rocco Rossi is President and CEO of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce Your Midday Sun From our newsroom to your inbox at noon, the latest headlines, stories, opinion and photos from the Toronto Sun.

When true believers become a danger to themselves and others,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-when-true-believers-become-a-danger-to-themselves-and-others/,www.theglobeandmail.com,Conservative Christians are leading resistance to COVID-19 vaccinations,['Michael Coren'],2021-08-13 10:00:00,"Michael Coren is an author and ordained cleric in the Anglican Church of Canada. The devil, it's said, has all the best tunes. Not sure if that's necessarily true, but Beelzebub certainly has an exemplary public relations department. How else can we explain how appalling the Christian world often appears at times of crisis? That's seldom been as bitingly obvious as during the COVID-19 pandemic, with resistance to vaccinations often led by conservative Christians. The vast majority of churchgoers aren't reactionary, and they've fully embraced lockdowns, physical distancing, and vaccinations, but that can't obscure the reality of the situation. Read right-wing Christian media platforms and websites, listen to their radio broadcasts, look at who is protesting, and the paranoia and anger are palpable. A poll this year by the U.S. Public Religion Research Institute found that a mere 45 per cent of white evangelicals said they would get vaccinated, the second-lowest acceptance rate of any religious affiliation, and the indications are that this number has remained fairly static. In Canada, the percentages seem to be higher, but the problem remains. Last December, for example, then-Conservative MP Derek Sloan, an outspoken social conservative, sponsored a parliamentary e-petition claiming: ""Bypassing proper safety protocols means COVID-19 vaccination is effectively human experimentation."" It received more than 41,000 signatures. The opposition to vaccines is multifaceted. The most ideologically plausible, if still bizarre, objection comes from those convinced that embryonic stem cells have been used in the development and manufacture of vaccines, and in some cases that may be true. Yet even the Vatican has said it's ""morally acceptable"" to receive a vaccination that has used cell lines derived from aborted fetuses, because of the ""grave danger"" of the pandemic. But Pope Francis is not popular with Catholic conservatives, and they look to alternative leaders such as Cardinal Raymond Burke, who has said the virus ""has been used by certain forces, inimical to families and to the freedom of nations, to advance their evil agenda. … These forces tell us that we are now the subjects of the so-called ‘Great Reset,' the ‘new normal,' which is dictated to us by their manipulation of citizens and nations through ignorance and fear."" This darling of the Catholic right, by the way, has just tested positive for COVID-19. Other forms of Christian anti-vaccine hysteria are drenched in ""hidden agenda"" fantasies, conspiracy theories about the state and secularism, and eschatological mania. There is a global battle, it is said, between the remnant of authentic Christians, be they Catholic or evangelical, and the Godless forces of government, media and business. COVID-19, and the vaccine response to it, are all part of the plan to control and dominate. There are myriad references to Masonic plots and the illuminati, and sometimes - predictably - this dark lunacy bleeds over into antisemitism. Not always though. One of the loudest resisters to vaccinations is a nun called Mother Miriam, a Jewish convert to Roman Catholicism, with a popular daily phone-in show in which she presents her ""mission to bring hope to a world that has lost its way."" Part of that mission, apparently, is to argue that vaccines are ""not only unethical and immoral, but have been proven to be very dangerous."" COVID-19, runs the anti-vaccine narrative, is either a hoax or, if real, is nothing more than a mild flu. If the latter, it has been exploited by plotting governments and elites to close churches, remove freedom of religion and impose vaccines. Donald Trump, always eager to echo fundamentalist rhetoric, said while still U.S. president that some states had closed places of worship, while allowing ""liquor stores and abortion clinics"" to stay open. The obsession with conspiracies isn't confined to Christian conservatives, and is typical of any subgroup that sees its place under threat by a world it can't accept or understand. The consequences, as we know only too well, can be fatal. In the Christian context, it's tied in with polemics about Armageddon, the end times, and the notion that vaccines contain the ""mark of the beast."" This nonsense is supposedly from the Book of Revelation, where the Antichrist is said to tempt Christians to mark their bodies. That's a callow misreading of the deeply complex final book of the New Testament, as much poetry as allegory, and demanding a non-literal approach. Problem is, literalism is at the broken heart of the anti-vaccine theocrats. Mingled together, it's a toxic and anti-social mess, with the true believers more determined than ever. ""Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing."" But that's from the Gospel of Luke, and not to be trusted - he was a doctor. Keep your Opinions sharp and informed.

"Omicron hotels not up to par, irritable travellers complain",https://www.thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/2021/12/07/omicron-hotels-not-up-to-par-irritable-travellers-complain.html,www.thestar.com,"Can reeking Canadians not wash their underlayers in a hotel sink? Where is our drive, our self-respect, our hand soap?","['Heather Mallick', 'Star Columnist']",2021-12-07 00:00:00,"There is one sub-genre of pandemic news reporting I shall not miss when all this is over. That is the wailing of global airline passengers forced to quarantine in airport hotels as their COVID-19 test results are assessed. For the hotel is always insufficient in so many ways. You would think travellers returning to Canada, a rules-based nation, would be grateful for careful testing, tracing, and tracking at the airport where people come from places around the world with different variants, vaccination rates, attitudes to vaccination, and rules for entry and exit. And no smart person would be travelling at the moment except in cases of exigency. But these travellers are seething. As one South African-born couple, Lennard and Charlotte Skead, told the CBC, after returning to Canada when Omicron popped up, they felt ""criminalized."" They couldn't get flights and were thoroughly and repeatedly inconvenienced, despite testing negative. ""It has made us feel as though we are not welcome in our own country and that we are carrying some kind of terrible disease that's going to be the end of the world."" Really. I wonder who would have possibly thought that. Other victims keened. Some told the Globe and Mail of being placed in hotels for days without access to laundry or enjoyable food, an almost Talibanist level of suffering. Some families with children were given the wrong-sized diapers and weren't served baby food. Imagine. Presumably they mashed it up themselves or possibly pre-chewed it, you know, the way birds do. Mary Ellen Havlik, a ""humanitarian consultant"" in Nigeria, returned to Canada and found the quarantine hotel lobby encased in plastic. ""It was just dystopian,"" she said in an interview with the Globe and Mail. Did she expect parachute silk? She was without luggage for four days. ""People were starting to get really belligerent. Some people were throwing their food out the window."" I doubt a Nigerian visitor would have been so rude. One man returning from South Africa complained his food was cold. Sara Sagaii, briefly quarantined in Vancouver after returning from Egypt via Istanbul, told the Globe she was served a ""basically rotten salad"" and had to wear the same clothes for three days. I'll interject. I live in a house with food and dishes and things. My husband's salads have ingredients. ""Oh, toasted sesame dressing, possibly orange juice, a citrus olive oil. I like microgreens."" Huh? ""Arugula and pea shoots."" This is the salad Sagaii wants. When I make salad, you could call it vegetable drawer scrapings a la Heather. This is the salad Sagaii got. Yet my family claims to love every bite (the bites are silent, aging carrots gone inexplicably soft). Take that approach. When I hear hotel laundry, I think of John Candy and Steve Martin in the movie ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles,"" after days on the road in rural America trying to get home for Thanksgiving, pleading for the world's worst single-bed motel room. ""Have mercy,"" Martin begs the desk clerk. ""I've been wearing the same underwear since Tuesday."" Candy leans in. ""I can vouch for that."" I think of British actor Richard E. Grant quarantined in a Gatwick Holiday Inn - perhaps he had ""gone on holiday by mistake"" - complaining about a packaged tuna and cucumber sandwich, a sausage casserole and fish and chips. Too pricey, he said. ""£228 a day to receive three meals of this very poor standard in a supposed four-star Holiday Inn Hotel beggars belief,"" he said on Twitter video without cracking a smile. The relevant government minister responded, saying it was hardly responsible for the state of Grant's fish and chips on a Friday night. I suspect Ottawa feels exactly the same. Correction - Dec. 9, 2021: This column was edited to remove a statement that traveller Mary Ellen Havlik was ""frightened"" by the sight of the hotel lobby encased in plastic."
"The COVID-19 pandemic. Climate change. Culture wars. For the West, the party is over",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-covid-19-pandemic-climate-change-culture-wars-for-the-west-the/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"With so many things going wrong at the same time, we have lost the ability to solve big problems and meet big challenges – and there is every reason to believe it may only get worse",['Andrew Potter'],2021-08-20 00:00:00,"Andrew Potter's latest book is On Decline: Stagnation, Nostalgia, and Why Every Year is the Worst One Ever. Seven months into Joe Biden's presidency, Americans - along with the rest of the Western world - are beginning to realize that Donald Trump wasn't the cause of our problems, but merely a symptom of them. And just as Mr. Trump wasn't the source of what ails us, the Biden presidency isn't the solution. The rot in the foundations of the West is deep, and we are still in the early stages of figuring out just how bad things are going to get. One of the more alarming features of our current moment is how a lot of serious things seem to be going wrong at the same time. Just as it looked like the COVID-19 pandemic had been brought under control, the Delta variant arrived. In Afghanistan, the continuing peace negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban fell apart this summer as the U.S. skulked out of the country - and with the withdrawal of foreign forces complete, the Taliban have retaken the country with astonishing speed. And this comes on the heels of the latest IPCC climate report, which suggested that we have already reached a position where many of the more dangerous aspects of climate change, such as deadly heat waves and powerful hurricanes, are close to being irreversible. What these and other looming crises have in common is that they are marked by a failure of some combination of political conviction, state capacity and collective action. We have lost the ability to solve big problems and meet big challenges, and there is every reason to think this is only going to get worse, thanks to the effects of a number of long-standing trends. These include the economic and technological stagnation that has been in place since at least the 1970s, the rise of highly polarized and tribalistic politics, and the high decadence of the internet-fuelled culture wars. These trends have a mutually reinforcing character to them. Economic growth doesn't just give us more stuff, it tends to make us better people. When everyone believes that things are getting better - that the pie is getting bigger for everyone and will continue to do so - they become more open to newcomers and more sanguine about diversity. But when growth slows or stalls, the opposite happens. People look at the shrinking pie, look askance at their neighbours, and become more close-minded and suspicious. This leads to reactionary politics, which are greatly exacerbated by the highly toxic hothouse nature of the internet, especially social media. The current culture war between the woke members of the ctrl-left and the conspiratorial nihilists of the alt-right is to a large extent a matter of social-media political dynamics colonizing our real-world institutions. The way Western governments struggled to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic has been basically one long case study in seeing all of these trends at work. From the earliest days of the pandemic, there has been a sharp divide between the incredible scientific work that was done - identifying the virus, developing tests and treatments, and ultimately a vaccine - on the one hand, and the lethargic and largely ineffectual political and bureaucratic effort that went into making use of that work. But even when governments were moved to action, they found themselves hamstrung by a population riven by tribalistic responses (such as to mask mandates) and magical thinking (such as with anti-vax beliefs). We are, increasingly, a society unable to confront and rationally address the problems we face. It wasn't supposed to turn out this way, since we in the West have for a long time congratulated ourselves on having pretty much figured progress out. Economic growth, technological innovation and political emancipation under the banner of liberal democracy was just what we do here - and we had every expectation that it would continue indefinitely. We even had a name for it: the end of history. But instead of progress, things are actually going backwards - including in many of the places where we thought it was most deeply entrenched, in particular the United States. Is it any wonder then that the world is such a mess? Civilization advances through the resolution of increasingly large and complex collective-action problems, and that was the chief function of many of the global institutions that were built after the Second World War. Military alliances, trade deals, transnational regulatory bodies - these were all the building blocks of the stability and prosperity of the postwar era. It is looking like we have reached the limits of our capacity for global collective action. The fiasco in Afghanistan has revealed the UN and NATO as highly ineffective organizations. Free trade has been discredited, geopolitical tensions are rising, and the world is retreating into protectionism and mercantilism. It's been nearly 30 years since the Earth Summit in Rio led to a groundbreaking climate convention, but we are no closer today to taking meaningful action on climate change. All of this is almost certainly a sign of what is to come. For the past 200 years or so, the relentless pace of innovation and discovery has made us rich and comfortable in ways that our ancestors would find miraculous. To them, our age would look like one giant and seemingly endless party. Except all the evidence points to the party coming to an end. This doesn't mean the apocalypse is nigh, but it does mean as an increasing number of major problems go unresolved, life will get more and more difficult every year. At some point in the future, we may look back upon this time and recognize that this is when we started to realize we were in decline. Keep your Opinions sharp and informed.

Who would refuse the COVID-19 vaccine? New research sheds some light,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-who-would-refuse-the-covid-19-vaccine-maybe-someone-who-feels/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"Polls show societal support for mandatory workplace vaccinations is overwhelming, but there remains a small minority of Canadians who are willing to lose their job – and their right to participate in a number of public spaces – rather than receive the vaccine",['John Ibbitson'],2021-11-03 20:24:53,"People listen to a speaker during a rally and march organized by those opposed to COVID-19 vaccination passports and public health measures in Vancouver on Sept. 8.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press Many public-sector and private employers set the end of October as the deadline for workers to prove they have been vaccinated against COVID-19, on pain of dismissal. It appears that nine-in-10 or better have complied. The remainder, research suggests, have such a heightened sense of self-importance, and such a diminished capacity for empathy, that they are willing to become pariahs. The level of compliance within the public service is phenomenal. The Treasury Board reported Wednesday that 98 per cent of the 268,000 members of the core public service (including the RCMP), are fully or partly vaccinated. The few holdouts face an unpaid leave of absence if they don't get their shots. The city of Calgary says that nine in 10 of its workers had received at least one dose of vaccine as of Monday. From here on, unvaccinated employees face mandatory testing and education programs. As of Dec. 1, workers will be required to pay for their twice-weekly tests. WestJet has suspended without pay about 4 per cent of its work force, or 290 people, who refused to show proof of vaccination. If they don't comply by the end of this month, they'll be fired. Those at risk of losing their job because they refuse to be vaccinated should not look to their unions for support. ""There isn't a whole lot we're going to be able to do for members who simply refuse to get vaccinated,"" said Chris Aylward, national president of the Public Service Alliance of Canada, in an interview. ""This is a workplace policy. It applies to everyone except for the very few who have legitimate exemptions."" We shouldn't underestimate the impact of these terminations. British Columbia has had to cancel some surgeries after more than 3,000 health care workers were suspended without pay for refusing to be vaccinated. Quebec and Ontario will not force mandatory vaccination of health care workers, fearing disruptions. Nonetheless, societal support for mandatory workplace vaccinations is overwhelming. Several polls revealed a large majority of Canadians support mandatory vaccinations in the workplace. For the small minority of Canadians who are willing to lose their job - and their right to fly or take the train, eat in restaurants, or see a movie or a game among other things - rather than receive the vaccine, the question remains: Who are they and why do they think that way? According to an Angus Reid Institute poll released Wednesday, they tend to be younger and male. Surprisingly, to this writer, they tend to be upper income rather than lower income. They are more likely to have voted Conservative or People's Party than Liberal or NDP. There are higher levels of unvaccinated people among Indigenous Canadians than the general population. Ninety-five per cent of those polled agreed with the statement that mandatory vaccinations represented overreach by government; 90 per cent say they believe the health risks of COVID-19 are exaggerated; 84 per cent trusted their immune system to handle the virus; 76 per cent worried the side effects could be worse than the disease; 55 per cent say the whole pandemic is a government conspiracy. (The online survey was conducted Sept. 29-Oct. 3 from a representative randomized sample of 5,011 adults who are members of Angus Reid Forum. The declared margin of error is within 2 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.) In a new study of vaccine refusal in 51 countries, researchers at the University of Nevada at Reno correlated vaccine refusal with a high feeling of invincibility along with little sense of obligation to community. ""These effects are most pronounced among individuals from countries lower in cultural collectivism (e.g., USA, U.K., Canada),"" the researchers found. The small number of people who are going to extremes to defy vaccines are determined, sometimes revoltingly so. About 30 anti-vax protesters went to the home of Alberta UCP MLA Tracy Allard on Sunday and left a noose on a miniature scaffold, painted with the text, ""no to masks, end the gov't, hang em all."" Who would do such a thing? Maybe someone who feels invincible, who has little empathy for others, who believes government is trying to beat them down, and who is determined to fight back, even if it costs them their job.

The importance of getting undocumented workers vaccinated,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2021/12/03/the-importance-of-getting-undocumented-workers-vaccinated.html,www.thestar.com,"In many places, migrant and undocumented workers are invisible to those around them. But they aren’t invisible to infectious disease. If we want to en...","['Chelsea Tao', 'Samrawit Lemma', 'Joseph Wong']",2021-12-03 00:00:00,"Around the world, wealthy countries have begun offering boosters to their most vulnerable citizens. We know that in order to bring the pandemic under control (i.e., herd immunity) we will likely need to protect over 90 per cent of the world's population through vaccination. This is an increase from the earlier conventional wisdom that 70 per cent we need to reach and vaccinate those who may have been excluded before. Not long ago, the White House promised to step up its contribution to the world's vaccine supply to improve access for the world's poor. And yet, tens of millions of undocumented migrants are living in the shadows. No amount of supply increase will resolve this problem if they cannot be vaccinated. What stands in the way of the undocumented getting their shots? Consider the immense challenges for them to access health care: financial, cultural, legal, technical and logistical barriers as well as the constant threat of detention and deportation, particularly when accessing state-run services. Researchers at the Reach Alliance, a program founded at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy, examine how critical interventions and innovations reach those who are the hardest to reach: those living in extreme poverty, the geographically remote, administratively invisible and marginalized. One of their current projects investigates the barriers of accessing health services by undocumented migrants in Thailand's border regions. There is a lack of policy clarity and consistency regarding undocumented migrants' access to vaccines. In many countries, undocumented migrants are barred from health services by law. In other cases, policies may appear to include migrants, but real-life conditions present obstacles that are difficult to overcome. Many governments around the world avoid publicizing the inclusion of undocumented migrants in their vaccination campaigns, fearing xenophobic reactions from their citizens. We have interviewed medical professionals, academics, and NGOs working in Thailand's border regions. Reaching undocumented migrants requires integrating and co-ordinating health and immigration policies across different ministries, which is difficult to do when government departments have conflicting policies. In Thailand, the Ministry of Health supports health care provision for undocumented migrants, while the Ministry of the Interior views such migrants as national security threats. Rather than co-ordinating policy, there is bureaucratic conflict. Prior to the pandemic, the consequences were felt mostly by the undocumented migrants themselves and the NGOs that seek to support them. Amidst the pandemic, ignoring millions of undocumented migrants risks peril for everyone. If governments are serious about reaching millions of undocumented migrants, policy-makers need to invest in robust health care infrastructure that meets migrants' cultural and language needs and are positioned to serve from within or near migrant communities. Cultural dissonance is a barrier to care and, as we have seen all around the world, is a concept known to fuel vaccine hesitancy. In addition, governments must accommodate the specific realities of undocumented migrants. For instance, in Thailand, the lack of flexibility when it comes to the transferability of one's health benefits hurts migrants the most. While Thai citizens benefit from the option to easily transfer their health care benefits between providers, migrants cannot. For undocumented persons who cannot meet complicated such administrative requirements, the lack of portability means that crucial health services, such as vaccinations, are out of reach. More broadly, governments prioritizing vaccinated populations should consider collaborating with local NGOs, which are in a far better position to connect, build trust, and help health care workers deliver targeted interventions to migrant communities. The Migrant Fund (M-Fund), a community-based health insurance program operating in Thailand's border regions, has proven to be especially capable at building trust among migrants because their staff come from the migrant community, are culturally sensitive and fluent in their language. They are more effective in outreach initiatives at migrant community hubs, including schools and community centres, because they are community-based and culturally appropriate. In many places, migrant and undocumented workers are invisible to those around them. But they aren't invisible to infectious disease. If we want to end the pandemic, we need to bridge this gap. The way to do that is through equitable access to health care for people who live their lives at the margins - care that is culturally, administratively and geographically inclusive."
A message to the vaccine hesitant: Time’s up,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-a-message-to-the-vaccine-hesitant-times-up/,www.theglobeandmail.com,Vaccination mandates are a reasonable response to the spread of the variant,['Marcus Gee'],2021-08-21 07:30:00,"Toronto Mayor John Tory at a COVID-19 vaccine centre in Toronto on July 23, 2021. Mr. Tory announced on Thursday that Toronto would make vaccinations mandatory for city employees.Chris Young/The Canadian Press There was little fuss when Mayor John Tory announced on Thursday that Toronto would make vaccinations mandatory for city employees. Nor should there have been. Governments and organizations across the country are resorting to vaccine mandates as the Delta variant of COVID-19 spreads and experts describe a fourth wave taking hold. The Toronto Public Library and the Toronto Transit Commission are bringing in mandates to match the city's. The five major banks are all doing something similar. The federal government is going to be asking all public servants to be vaxxed; airline and rail passengers, too. Quebec will require a vaccine passport to get into restaurants, festivals and gyms. British Columbia says that those working in care homes must get their jab. City of Toronto mandates COVID-19 vaccinations for municipal workers This is not the way anyone wanted to go. Authorities have been understandably reluctant to make shots obligatory. They haven't wanted to trample on individual autonomy or invite lawsuits. Persuasion, they rightly argued, is always preferable to coercion. And so, for many months, officials have been putting the message out that the vaccines are safe and that every eligible Canadian should get inoculated as soon as possible. For the most part it worked. After a slow start, Canada has become a vaccination leader. But we are once again in a tricky spot. Just as it looked as if the pandemic was easing, the Delta variant arrived in force, sending case numbers up again. The unvaccinated are, of course, the most vulnerable. ""In fact,"" says the Macdonald-Laurier Institute in a new report, ""there is strong evidence emerging that the impact of this latest wave, and the most serious cases within it, is almost entirely concentrated on the unvaccinated. Getting back to a normal life now rests on how many and how fast people get vaccinated. Evidence from around the world shows that vaccination rates do plateau, so getting the hesitant and the reluctant populations vaccinated is critical for the next phase of the fight against COVID-19."" Toronto's public health department reported this week that ""98.7 per cent of hospitalized COVID-19 cases with known vaccination status were not fully vaccinated."" So it's strongly in the self-interest of the unvaccinated to get their jabs. COVID-19 can still kill you. It can still make you very sick. Those who have persuaded themselves that this ordeal is all over or that they can never be infected have not been paying attention. Worse, they have been disregarding their obligation to their fellow citizens. If large numbers of Canadians continue to remain unvaccinated, the disease is bound to continue spreading and mutating. We need more needles in more arms. Otherwise we will be right back into lockdowns and closures and all the other life-crushing measures we have seen over the last miserable year and a half. The old excuses for not getting vaxxed, always weak, now look positively deluded. There is more than enough vaccine to go around and appointments for a shot are readily available for just about everybody. ""I'm too busy"" or ""it's too inconvenient"" or ""I just don't think I need it"" doesn't cut it any more. We learned from a slew of trials that the COVID-19 vaccines were remarkably safe and effective. Many months of experience and millions of vaccinations have confirmed it. The alarms over side effects and dangers have faded. It is hard to argue now that the vaccines are too new or too experimental to take the risk. The risk from the virus is and always has been infinitely greater. Yet a significant number of people still believe that the vaccine is what is dangerous. We can't afford to indulge them any more. Vaccine mandates are a way of saying: time's up. Moderately and lawfully applied, they are a perfectly reasonable response to the combined threat of a new variant and lingering vaccine hesitancy. Most Canadians back them. Toronto's mayor, Mr. Tory, was right to act. Keep your Opinions sharp and informed. Get the Opinion newsletter. Sign up today."
Brace yourself for more COVID-19 nastiness,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-brace-yourself-for-more-covid-19-nastiness/,www.theglobeandmail.com,The Delta variant poses a new kind of threat to Canadian society – unless we can come together and keep community spread in check,['André Picard'],2021-08-09 14:51:59,"""Nasty fall ahead."" Those three words, tweeted by the ever-insightful David Naylor, the co-chair of the federal COVID-19 immunity task force, pretty well summarize what awaits us as we try to look beyond the once-hopeful summer of 2021. The much-dreaded fourth wave of COVID-19 has begun in much of Canada. Fuelled by the Delta variant, it could be the toughest one yet. The fall and winter of 2021 likely won't be anywhere near as devastating as the winter of 2020, at least in sheer numbers. We can thank Canadians' broad embrace of vaccination for that. Delta variant stands to tap brakes on Canadian economy, not slam them But we're going to experience a new kind of nasty, with a lot more children and young adults getting sick and hospitalized than in earlier waves. With ageism rampant in our society, it felt as if Canadians were shrugging off the death of elders. Of the 26,669 COVID-19 deaths recorded in Canada so far, 18,194 have occurred in residential facilities, principally long-term care homes, according to data compiled by journalist Nora Loreto. Seeing children on life support in intensive care units will be a whole other matter. We need look no further than pediatric hospitals in Louisiana and Texas to get a sense of what could be coming. To date, young people have not been as hard-hit by COVID-19. But the Delta variant is different; people of all ages are getting sicker quicker, especially if they are unvaccinated. A significant minority of infected children and youth will develop lasting symptoms, a condition called ""long COVID."" The fourth wave is also unfurling in a markedly different socio-political environment. The pandemic is now a pandemic of the unvaccinated. The unjabbed account for almost all cases, hospitalizations and deaths. The unvaccinated are principally split into two distinct groups: those for whom vaccines are not yet available, such as children under 12, and those who are choosing to not be vaccinated. The small minority of vaccine denialists, vaccine opponents and anti-lockdown activists are becoming increasingly obnoxious, their embrace of disinformation and conspiracy theories more adamant. The vaccinated are increasingly angry, too. They don't appreciate their civism being undermined, and are demanding vaccine mandates, certificates and passports, and punitive measures against those still refusing. Many governments, especially conservative ones, are abandoning public-health measures, betting that the public (or at least their base) is fed up with pandemic restrictions. The problem is not that governments have loosened rules, which was largely justified by low case counts and high vaccination rates; it's that many never established metrics or set out terms for potentially reinstating them if things went south. As numbers rise, we will undoubtedly see some backpedalling, with a return to masking and limits on social gatherings, but they will be increasingly difficult to enforce. Hopefully we won't see perverse actions such as the punishments being handed out by Florida's Governor on businesses insisting on masks or proof of vaccination. In the U.S., the response to COVID-19 has become deeply partisan, with Democrats embracing masks and vaccines, and Republicans vehemently rejecting them. We can't afford to have that happen in Canada, but the current sniping between Ottawa and the Alberta government does not bode well. There is a danger, too, that a federal election - which is looking increasingly likely to come soon - could exacerbate this political cleavage. Still, there is hope. Our actions (or inaction) will determine the size of the wave and, ultimately, how nasty the fall will be. Since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic - in case you've forgotten, the virus was being reported as early as late 2019 - Canada has enjoyed the advantage of looking to other jurisdictions that were hit earlier to get a sense of what was coming our way. That advantage remains true today. What is happening in the U.S. and Europe today foreshadows what we can expect in the coming weeks and months: A sharp rise in cases, and a spike in hospitalizations and deaths, particularly in the unvaccinated. But none of this is inevitable here. Despite all the noisy disinformation out there, we need to remember that vaccines work remarkably well. Canada has just surpassed 50 million doses administered, and 23.3 million Canadians are fully vaccinated. Masking and physical distancing also remain effective, and we shouldn't abandon them too hastily. Our particular focus this fall and winter needs to be on children and youth. Ensuring they can attend school as safely as possible means having some clear guidelines, and investing in measures such as ventilation and smaller class sizes. But the single biggest factor in protecting children remains keeping community spread of the novel coronavirus in check. If we do that, then come early 2022, we'll be able to look back and say: ""It wasn't so nasty after all."" Keep your Opinions sharp and informed. Get the Opinion newsletter. Sign up today."
All I want for Christmas is you (and your negative COVID test result),https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/opinion/2021/12/08/all-i-want-for-christmas-is-you-and-your-negative-covid-test-result.html,www.thestar.com,Vinay Menon wonders: Do we have the right to know anyone’s vaccination status?,"['Vinay Menon', 'Entertainment Columnist']",2021-12-08 00:00:00,"Imagine getting this holiday eCard from a loved one: ""IT'S THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF YEAR (IF YOU TEST COVID CLEAR)."" My guess is your festive spirit may give way to indignation. And that's before you click inside: Happy Holidays, And best of the season! I need you to do something (I have a really good reason.) We can't wait to see you, You guys are the best. But before we meet up, Please take a COVID test. This is just one of five eCards available this week from Rapid Test & Trace Canada, which believes there is a market need ""to humorously handle Canadians' most uncomfortable holiday ask."" According to company research, ""only 46.5 per cent of Canadians plan to ask family and friends to get a COVID test to ensure safety before holiday visits."" That number seems high, ""only"" because I'm apparently in the 7.7 per cent of Canadians who could never demand family and friends swab their nostrils before they remove their boots and I pour them a glass of spiked eggnog in the din of B.B. King's jazzy renditions. This might also reflect my gender. Company research found, ""Canadian men are much more concerned about asking for previsit COVID tests with a definitive 70.8 per cent saying they ‘could never ask,' vs. only 29.2 per cent of women."" Why are women so much more sensible than men? Why? Now, since this firm is in the business of testing, I get why they are pushing testing. It's the same reason KFC pushes fried chicken. And if I didn't know my family and friends were vaccinated, yes, I might be sending these eCards and stuffing stockings with thermometers and rapid tests. Here's a question I've been pondering lately: Do we have the right to know anyone's vaccination status? A couple of weeks ago, I was looking into a tip. I was told a famous Canadian actor, who I won't name, was not vaccinated and continuing to work on-set during the pandemic. So, I reached out to this actor's publicist, who was very nice at first and said they did not know but would get back to me. The tone quickly changed. I was then told I was asking for ""confidential medical information,"" and that ""privacy laws"" prevented any comment. As I pointed out to the publicist, when I go to a restaurant, I must provide proof of vaccination. It's not as if I was asking for this actor's cholesterol score or an EKG of a resting heart rate. This person is a public figure. We are in a public health crisis. Across the border, actors have lost roles for refusing to get jabbed. I didn't think I was out of line. This seemed newsworthy, and still does. But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe the medical status, even for a public figure, is private and none of my damn business. This is the thin ethical pond we are all skating upon this holiday season. As I look at these new eCards - ""All I want for Christmas (is to keep it COVID free),"" ""#CANCEL COVID CHRISTMAS"" - I can only imagine the family fights some will soon endure. According to Rapid Test & Trace, 57.2 per cent Canadians anticipate arguments that hinge on the pandemic this year, including ""getting fully vaccinated (22.1 per cent),"" ""limiting visits (22.9 per cent),"" and ""getting a COVID test before visiting (12.2 per cent)."" Family rows during the holidays used to be about politics or bad gifts. Now Uncle John is gathering the kids near the tree to tell them a tale about how Bill Gates created the 'rona to implant masses with tracking devices for the impending depopulation purge. Now Cousin Susie is calling Uncle John a stupid anti-vaxxer as the kids begin to weep and ask if Santa got his booster. Now your paranoid sister is basting the turkey with Purell. Now your grandfather is calling Louis Pasteur a communist. Now your spouse has vanished in the attic with a bottle of Jack Daniels. And now you are praying Rudolph crashes through your front door, delivering a flying hoof to the head that leaves you unconscious under the mistletoe. Merry Christmas! I have friends who have cut ties with a loved one who believes COVID is a hoax or that masks are for sheeple suckers who don't cherish liberty. These are markedly different holiday disputes than, say, why the Leafs will never win the Cup. These differences are entrenched and intractable. That unnamed famous Canadian actor I mentioned earlier, honestly, a part of me now believes he or she might well be a reckless conspiracy theorist protected by a skittish production company. I have no proof beyond one nagging question: Why wouldn't he or she just say if they're vaxxed? The holiday season was stressful enough long before the pandemic cranked up our fears and suspicions. I have no idea if there really is a market need for rapid testing holiday eCards this Christmas. I mean, even Scrooge must be furrowing his brow. But if there is a need, this much is clear: the profound contrasts in how we responded to safety measures and governmental action will end up tearing way more families apart than the virus. And not even Hallmark can repair the long-term damage. Canada is now divided into three: people who take COVID-19 seriously, too seriously or not seriously enough. Chances are, you know someone from all three groups. It's a challenging parlour game, especially when planning a holiday gathering."
It is time to wake up and fight global vaccine inequity,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2021/12/01/it-is-time-to-wake-up-and-fight-global-vaccine-inequity.html,www.thestar.com,The global vaccine inequity is ethically despicable but also dangerous from a public health perspective. Throughout the pandemic we repeated the mantr...,['Vardit Ravitsky'],2021-12-01 00:00:00,"The Omicron variant is currently threatening the world with a potential new wave of COVID-19. It comes on the backdrop of extreme pandemic fatigue and the start of Canadian winter. Nobody wants to go back to lockdown. While variants will occur no matter what we do and not all variants are necessarily more dangerous, some of them can pose new threats. And the best way to slow down their appearance is vaccination. There could be, and likely is, a direct link between the rise of variants and the low vaccination rate in some parts of the world. In most rich countries vaccination rates are around 60 to 80 per cent. Across the African continent they are at 7 per cent. Even in South Africa, which has relatively more resources, it is only 24 per cent. COVAX was meant to help countries that could not purchase vaccines at standard market price. Instead, wealthy countries jumped the line and purchased most of the world's vaccines. They currently sit on abundant quantities, struggling with vaccine resistance. While rich countries are trying desperately to convince their privileged, hesitating citizens to get vaccinated, poor countries are grappling with shortage of desired life-saving vaccines. While rich countries are rolling out a third dose, citizens of poor countries are unable to get even a single one. This global inequity is ethically despicable but also dangerous from a public health perspective. Throughout the pandemic we repeated the mantra ""nobody is safe until everyone is safe,"" but we did not act responsibly. The current situation must change. Fast. So what should we do? Rich countries must urgently continue to donate vaccine doses and money to fulfil their promises. Canada, for example, promised to donate 50 million doses (and the equivalent of 200 million by the end of 2022), but to date only donated 8 million. Moreover, the capacity to produce vaccines locally in low-resource countries should be enhanced, and for that intellectual property barriers need to be removed. But this is also the time to learn the lessons of COVID-19 for the next global pandemic. Future pandemic preparedness is the topic of the current meeting of the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the WHO. In preparation for this critically important meeting, African health ministers, researchers and organizations led the development of an open letter, in which they propose key principles for doing better next time. They call on all countries with excess vaccine doses to immediately donate them. They call on all recipients to commit to an equitable and fair distribution of vaccines within their countries. They call for greater participation of African nations in vaccine research, and urge pharmaceutical companies to set up production facilities in Africa. They ask the WHO to set up an international, independent, publicly funded permanent successor to COVAX, that would purchase and distribute treatments and vaccines in the event of a future pandemic. The goal would be to vaccinate 70 per cent of the world's population within the first year. To accomplish this, they call for the creation of a pandemic insurance fund. They ask all G20 nations to donate collectively 0.1 per cent of their GDP - or $10 billion per year. This is a fraction of the nearly 3 trillion dollars lost in GDP due to COVID so far. Such a fund would set the world well in advance, so countries will not have to scramble for vaccines during a global emergency. Considering how often African needs are ignored, it is critical to ensure African voices are well represented. We owe it to low- and middle- income countries to be mindful of the needs of the Global South. But the creation of such a pandemic insurance fund would benefit rich countries as well. When it comes to pandemic preparedness, humanitarianism is practical. As we witness the rise of the Omicron variant, we must see low- and middle-income nations as partners in combating a common enemy. The Canadian delegation at the World Health Assembly should support a vote on these principles of vaccine equity. Future generations will judge us based on our current action, or inaction. Canada, with its proud commitment to equality, solidarity, and human rights, needs to do what it takes now to be on the right side of history."
"Parents, it’s now up to you. COVID vaccines are right for kids and everyone else",https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2021/11/22/parents-its-now-up-to-you-covid-vaccines-are-right-for-kids-and-everyone-else.html,www.thestar.com,"‘Parents in Ontario have an opportunity to do something important for their kids, themselves and everyone else. They should seize it with both hands.’",['Star Editorial Board'],2021-11-22 00:00:00,"Parents in Ontario (and soon right across the country) now have an opportunity to do something important for their kids, themselves and everyone else. They should seize it with both hands. As of Tuesday, they'll be able to go online and book an appointment for their children (aged 5 to 11) to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The first shots are expected to be given out on Thursday. The more kids get vaccinated, and the quicker that happens, the better for them and the better for all of us. It will be another big step toward finally putting this terrible, destructive pandemic behind us. There's every reason for parents to sign their kids up without delay, but that can't be taken for granted. Instead, there are disturbing signs that a significant minority of parents aren't going to take the opportunity. One recent survey, by the Angus Reid Institute, suggests only half of parents intend to get their kids vaccinated as soon as possible. And almost a quarter (23 per cent) say they simply don't plan on having their children inoculated. That just isn't good enough. We've now lived through 20 months of COVID-19 and we know the damage it wreaks - in lives, in physical and mental health, in the overall well-being of our society and economy. Parents who refuse to get their children vaccinated, or count themselves among the ""hesitant"" for whatever reason, are doing everyone a disservice - including the very children they claim to be protecting. For one thing, the medical evidence is clear. Most young children who get COVID-19 don't become seriously ill, but some do. And some suffer long-term effects (including a serious condition called multi-system inflammatory syndrome, or MIS-C) that are difficult to predict. Vaccines are the best way to protect them, like everyone else, from the disease. Even kids who don't get badly ill can spread COVID to others, including more vulnerable people. Surely no child wants to be an unwitting risk to a grandparent or someone with an underlying condition that makes them more susceptible to the disease. School-age children have already suffered from the ""collateral harms"" of the pandemic. Their schools have been closed for months and even now many aren't having a normal school experience. They're still being kept in cohorts and can't mix freely with other kids. Ending the pandemic is the only way to recover regular, pre-pandemic life for them, and the quicker the better. Whatever slight risks from vaccines exist, the dangers of contracting COVID are considerably greater. A basic risk-benefit analysis tips the balance in favour of getting your shots, for the young as much as for others. All these are excellent reasons for parents to sign their kids up right away. But we know from experience that a sizable number won't act quickly, and some won't get their children vaccinated no matter how much cajoling and counselling is offered. No one wants to see kids penalized, especially kids who aren't getting their shots simply because their parents are too obstinate or idle to get them to a vaccine clinic. Certainly, everything possible should be done to make that as easy and available as possible and remove whatever barriers exist to vaccination. But it's also true that, in the end, kids need to get their shots. Ontario has accepted that principle since 1982 when it made vaccination against nine diseases (measles, mumps, chickenpox and so on) a condition of attending school. The COVID vaccine, as we've argued before, should be added to that list. After all the talk is done, vaccination is vital for children, and for everyone else. Parents, it's now up to you."
Every health care worker needs to be vaccinated without exception - or find another job,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-every-health-care-worker-needs-to-be-vaccinated-without-exception-or/,www.theglobeandmail.com,Patient-centered care means that a patient’s right to not be harmed comes before a worker’s right to privacy,['André Picard'],2021-10-04 13:17:46,"Despite their education, health workers are susceptible to the same fear-mongering and misinformation spread by anti-vaxxers as members of the general public.Paul Chiasson/The Canadian Press Diane Sims has lived with multiple sclerosis for decades. Now, at age 63, the author and former journalist is dying. She has accepted that stoically. As she strives to eke joy out of her final weeks and days, Ms. Sims just doesn't want her death hastened by COVID-19. Yet, the health care workers who come to her home in Stratford, Ont., daily to provide palliative care - toileting, bathing, dressing etc. - don't have to be vaccinated against the pandemic illness. According to the home-care agency that employs the workers, no one is even allowed to ask them their vaccination status - not even a dying woman who is at high risk of infection. This is nonsense. The so-called privacy rights of workers are not absolute. And they are more than offset by a patient's right to not be put in harm's way. ""I feel violated and betrayed,"" Ms. Sims told me. ""I don't want to have to choose between getting care and putting my life at risk."" Ontario has slowly and reluctantly mandated that health care workers be vaccinated. (Other provinces have also done so, to varying degrees.) The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the myth of universal public health care in Canada When it comes to lifting pandemic public health measures, handle with care First, there were ""mandatory"" vaccination rules for those who work in hospitals - rules that vary from institution to institution. Then the province got around to mandating vaccination in long-term care homes, where thousands upon thousands of elders died gruesome deaths from COVID-19. But there is no vaccine mandate for home-care workers, or in other non-institutional parts of the system. Just because our health care system is a mess of disconnected institutions and programs doesn't mean our rules and regulations need to be equally obtuse. Vaccine mandates are essential in health care, but they can't be vague. To be effective, they have to be universal, unambiguous and have clear deadlines and punishing consequences if violated. Quebec got it right. The provincial Health Minister, Christian Dube, said all workers, form clerks to physicians, must be vaccinated, without exception. Those who don't want to get their COVID-19 shots have a clear choice between the jab or their job. Quebec's deadline is Oct. 15, a little more than a week away. Those who are not fully vaccinated by that time will be suspended without pay and potentially fired if they don't meet the vaccination requirement promptly. At last count, 17,624 health care workers in the province have not received even one dose, almost half of them front-line workers. That's a lot of essential workers to lose, especially in the midst of a worsening health human-resources crisis. But Quebec can't blink. If there is one thing that will cause staff shortages in the short term, it's an outbreak of COVID-19 in a hospital. The larger human-resources issue can't be resolved by neglecting patient safety. Like New York State, Canadian jurisdictions need hard-core vaccination mandates. And, as is happening in New York, the vast majority of health workers will come around, rolling up their sleeves for shots, even if it is at the last minute. It's unclear why a small minority of health workers are reluctant to be vaccinated. Despite their education, health workers are susceptible to the same fear-mongering and misinformation spread by anti-vaxxers (many of whom have financial interests in flogging ""alternative medicine"") as members of the general public. Many health workers, burned out and angry at their work conditions, are simply tired of being put upon and told what to do. Their anger is justified, but refusing vaccination and putting patients at risk is not the way to express frustration. Ms. Sims, who has a rotation of 12 home-care workers, says four of them have told her explicitly they refuse to be vaccinated. One said the vaccine was ""poison,"" and another feared it contained a microchip. (Both are common, nonsensical claims circulating on social media.) When the unvaccinated workers are scheduled, Ms. Sims tells them they are not welcome in her home. She goes without essential care. The agency refuses to provide other, vaccinated workers. That is the antithesis of patient-centred care. The time for encouraging, persuading, cajoling and educating workers has passed. There needs to be a stark choice presented to anyone who wants to work in the health system: Get a COVID-19 vaccine or find another line of work. As Ms. Sims so eloquently stated, workers who refuse to be vaccinated during a pandemic are violating and betraying the most fundamental ethical principle that must guide their work: First, do no harm.

Travel bans expose continued enforcement of colonialism,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2021/12/03/travel-bans-expose-continued-enforcement-of-colonialism.html,www.thestar.com,"So far, all major policy responses — from travel bans to lockdowns and vaccine rollouts — prioritize countries and citizens of the Global North while ...","['Rachel Silver', 'S. Nombuso Dlamini', 'Nathan Englander']",2021-12-03 00:00:00,"On Nov. 26, last Friday, Canada suspended travel from South Africa and six of its neighbouring countries. The suspensions spurred heated debate, with South Africa feeling ""punished"" for having identified the Omicron variant. There is reason to feel punished. Travel restrictions are just the latest symptom of a colonial approach to COVID-19. The ban will devastate the region's economy, while passengers from the U.K., Germany, Italy, Belgium and other countries where Omicron had been detected continue to fly. Two days later, on Sunday, Omicron was discovered in Ontario. Yet, on Tuesday, Canada extended the ban, adding three more African countries - Malawi, Nigeria, and Egypt - to the red list. This, despite consensus among public health officials that travel bans in this case were ineffective. History has taught us that colonialism is about power and the marginalization of those deemed to be ""less than"" and ""other."" So far, all major policy responses - from travel bans to lockdowns and vaccine rollouts - prioritize countries and citizens of the Global North while systematically depriving countries of the Global South from accessing the resources required to protect themselves. The region has sufficient brainpower and capacity to manufacture doses if licensing were allowed. South Africa, alone, has a robust research infrastructure. But to give Southern Africa resources and authority would affect power dynamics: it would shatter the illusion that public health expertise lies in the North and that vaccine equity is a matter of goodwill. It would diminish a sense of missionary beneficence, gained through donating (often soon-to-expire) doses. And it would make clear that these bans are not logical, but psychological, as epidemiologist Farhad Razak said on CBC's Metro Morning. To decolonize COVID-19; to take seriously local solutions to local manifestations of a global virus is not a matter of selflessness. It acknowledges historic extraction from the continent, and it takes seriously what the supply chain, and climate change, have made undeniably clear: The whole world is connected. An equitable, global solution is required to manage COVID-19. Though we've long been aware that widespread vaccination might have prevented an Omicron, countries of the Global North were hoarding vaccines. On Jan. 31, the New York Times reported: ""While more than 90 million people worldwide have been vaccinated, only 25 in all of sub-Saharan Africa, a region of about one billion people, have been given doses outside of drug trials, according to the World Health Organization."" Again, not 25 million, 25 people. This means that the entire Southern African region has served as a viable testing ground for the vaccine, which ultimately benefits the global citizen. If testing is appropriate for the South, why not vaccine laboratories that would allow for a locally brewed but internationally dispensed solution to the virus? To level the vaccine field and create equitable distribution, the global COVAX initiative was created in April 2020. Still today, with nearly 80 per cent of Canadians fully vaccinated, rates in Africa remain low. Only 24 per cent of South Africans are fully vaccinated, while in Malawi, another country covered by the ban, only 3 per cent have received two doses. This is an ethical failure. But it is not surprising. According to the WHO's Vaccine Equity Campaign, high income countries must increase health-care spending by 0.8 per cent to vaccinate 70 per cent of their population. For low-income countries to do the same would require a staggering 56.6 per cent increase. Southern African governments simply do not have the resources to compete for shots in a global marketplace where, at the start of mass rollout, rich countries were outbidding each other and reportedly topping $50 for a complete two-shot Pfizer dose. Debate today centres on the travel ban, but let's debunk that right now. If COVID spreading via air travel was in any way the primary concern, bans would also extend to other countries where Omicron was first detected. It would cover the United States, a country on the cusp of a staggering 800,000 COVID deaths that allows people to fly unvaccinated and untested while the Delta variant rages. This is the colonial part: it's about who is telling whom not to travel. As it stands, Canadian travel policy evokes age-old and racist fears of Joseph Conrad's Dark Continent. Rather than focus on restricting travel, which, if efficacious, should be uniformly applied, debate should highlight the effects of the colonial gaze. Resources should be directed to acknowledge and give credit to the Southern African experts for identifying the variant. These resources may also be used to support the development of solutions about the virus expertise that could be globally disseminated between North and South. Just like all those airplanes, solutions would travel freely in both directions."

Sacha Bhatia and William Falk: Virtual care should become a central pillar of a new health delivery system that ensures all Canadians get the right care at the right time Photo by Getty Images/iStockphoto One very big silver lining to 2020 was the dramatic uptake in the use of virtual health care in Canada. During the first wave of the pandemic over 70 per cent of outpatient care was delivered virtually. Before COVID-19, speaking to a family doctor about a new health problem, simply getting a prescription renewal or having a visit with a specialist required most Canadians to take time off work, travel to their local clinic or hospital and sit in a waiting room for upwards of an hour or more. But now doctors can bill for virtual visits and Canadians can receive medical care from the comfort of their own home. As the second wave crests, and hospitals are once again filling up with COVID patients, providing care to other patients while keeping them safe and out of our hospitals and clinics is critical. Our recently published C.D. Howe policy paper , ""Canada's Virtual Care Revolution: A Framework for Success,"" outlines a roadmap to making virtual care an integral part of the health system, now and into the future. There have always been costs to in-person care, but they have traditionally been borne primarily by patients, not by providers or the health system. Patients lost wages and had to pay for travel and parking. These costs were a minor nuisance for some, but a serious impediment for others. For providers, the COVID pandemic created significant costs to physical contact, including the risk of viral transmission, increased use of personal protective equipment (PPE), quarantine and isolation time, serious worry and, in some cases, bouts of COVID itself for themselves and their families. In the pandemic's first days, governments wisely liberalized billing codes so physicians could bill video and phone visits using existing infrastructure. Rapid virtualization of care followed, ensuring patients suffering from such chronic diseases as diabetes, mental illness and heart disease could receive regular care with reduced infection risk, to patients and providers alike. More On This Topic Richard C. Owens: Seizing pharma profits kills pharma investment Peter St. Onge: We need to reset Canadian health care William Watson: Forget cases, focus on hospitalizations Opinion: COVID is superspreading efficient and convenient health care As the first deliveries of COVID vaccines allow us to begin thinking about a return to a more normal life it's not yet clear whether advances in virtual care will be sustained. We believe virtual care should stay, and should become a central pillar of a new health delivery system that ensures all Canadians get the right care at the right time. The fundamental redesign of health-care delivery that we would like to see starts with three simple questions: Is this service really necessary? Can it be delivered virtually? And where is the right place for in-person contact? ""Is this service really necessary?"" speaks to the issue of medical appropriateness, which took on greater importance during the pandemic, when both patients and providers weighed the benefit of treatment against the risk of infection. In some cases, both sides may agree that no treatment is really required. Routine pre-operative testing before low-risk surgeries, like cataract operations, is a good example of a service that could just be done away with. ""Can it be delivered virtually?"" is about more than simply Zoom. The video and telephone visits with providers that Canadians have grown used to since last spring could be expanded to include asynchronous messaging like email, remote monitoring of patients using such wearable devices as the Apple Watch, or online mental health counselling. Before COVID, many Canadians felt they had no choice but to incur the personal costs of visiting their health-care provider. Now that they know such costs really aren't necessary, they may well insist - and in our view they should - on virtual service. As to the ""right place for in-person contact,"" even if a health service really does need to be delivered in person, a hospital or clinic isn't necessarily the best place for meeting. Home-based therapies, for example, delivered by homecare nurses and connected to the broader care team digitally, could be promising ways to manage patients with such chronic diseases as heart failure. A modern health-care system underpinned by virtual care will require a modern policy framework for it to be sustainable. Virtual care is care and needs to be treated as such. Virtual care models should be safe and clinically effective, and the impact on costs and outcomes should be both measurable and in fact measured. Compensation structures will have to include the full suite of virtual care tools, including both real-time virtual visits and email or text communications. Finally, we will need to take a common-sense approach to health information that balances privacy and health care needs. The COVID pandemic has forced a once-in-a-generation innovation on the health-care sector. Sustaining and advancing our gains in virtual care post-vaccine will be crucial to building the patient-centred health-care system all Canadians want. R.

But at least one of his spawn is likely giving Premier Dad, who is trying to navigate COVID-19 and taking endless heat from every corner of the grumbling spectrum, a honkin' huge headache in the here and now. Krista Ford Haynes, eldest of the quartet, would fall into the vaccine-nix column. She's made her views abundantly clear on social media. This week, Krista is in a rage because her cop husband was apparently suspended, sent home with his packed up dolls and dishes, because of his vaccination status. (Employees of the Toronto Police Service had until Nov. 30 to get jabbed or provide medical documentation justifying an opt-out.) It appears that hubby Sgt. Dave Haynes is among those who are vaccination-averse. The non-compliant are to be placed on unpaid leave. Now, as a rule, family members of politicians shouldn't be media fodder. Many of us have kinfolk who for whatever cockamamie reason will not get vaccinated. We can't be judged by the blood relatives we keep - at a safe distance. I'm sure the Kennedy clan isn't thrilled about Robert Kennedy Jr., son of the assassinated presidential candidate, morphing into an anti-vaccine activist - his Instagram account permanently taken down for repeatedly sharing ""debunked claims"" about COVID-19 and vaccines. Junior heads an outfit, Children's Health Defense, skeptical about the health benefits of vaccination and has even campaigned against immunization for measles. Sometimes the apple falls really, really far from the tree. Likewise Krista Ford Haynes has made herself fair game. This week, she posted a fistful of Instagram stories sharing her perspiration-sodden thoughts - it looks like she's in a gym, working out, so presumably a home gym - expressing her grievances. To wit (or, rather, wit-less): ""Never thought I'd see the day. Twenty years into the job, he so faithfully served, after just earning a promotion to Staff Sergeant."" Following up a day later with: ""Going to jump on here and give you my sweaty cardio thoughts and explain yesterday's post."" Blah-blah-blah. ""I'm telling you guys, God wins every single time. I do believe the people behind all of this will be held accountable don't know when, but I truly believe God wins. Evil does not win."" Is KFH calling pops evil? Many have called him worse. But shade thrown by one's own kid on a public platform? Premier King Lear, perchance agonizing over a wayward daughter - where did we go wrong, Karla? - Krista-Cassandra. Or maybe closer to Tom Hanks' wacko son, Chet - both his parents have had COVID-19 - spreading nonsense on Instagram. ""There's more evidence for UFOs being real than that vaccine being healthy for you,"" he's ranted. ""Let's be real. Ninety-nine per cent of you motherf-kers couldn't use a shampoo that isn't FDA-approved, but you're willing to get some experimental government injection."" Pity you can't inject smarts! There are hordes of vaccine-resisters who've followed their conscience at a high cost to household income, family estrangement and isolation. They are entitled to their entitlement, preferably if they do so quietly and at no risk to others. But the caterwauling protesters, the selfish placard-wielders outside hospitals blithely obstructing staff and harassing patients, are a carbuncle on the social commonweal. KFH's vaccine condemnatio - at the very least her opposition to vaccine mandates - comes at a particularly worrisome juncture. On Friday, the World Health Organization declared a new strain of SAR-CoV-2 menace - dubbed the Omicron variant, named B. 1.1.529 - that has spread quickly in South Africa. Researchers initially spotted B. 1.1.529 in genome-sequencing data from Botswana, where it first surfaced. Scientists are racing to determine whether the microbe, which contains upwards of 30 changes in the spike protein, poses an increased threat of infection, compared to its forebears, its level of transmissibility, and whether it might make people sicker and if it's able to evade the vaccines and therapeutics available now. ""We're flying at warp speed,"" Penny Moore, a virologist at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, told Nature magazine. That lab is gauging the variant's potential to dodge immunity from vaccines and previous infections. ""At this stage, it's too early to tell anything."" Researchers are frantic to measure the variant's potential to spread globally, triggering a new wave of infection and exacerbating the continuing ravage driven by the Delta strain. Just when we were starting to see daylight at the end of this long, damn tunnel of plague, cunning coronavirus opens up another infectious front. So we're maybe back where we started. Although much more is known about the pathogen, obviously, and with vaccines a godsend, we're, herewith, returning to coping mechanisms circa March 2020, with Ottawa among many world capitals immediately banning foreign nationals from entry if they've been to any of seven countries in the past fortnight. From gotcha booster shots and vaccinating of children to KEEP OUT! redux. Experts have long predicted that the more the virus spreads, the more likely it is to mutate and result in strains that could be more dangerous to everyone, including the vaccinated. Rollout of vaccines has not been globally equitable, meaning high death rates and serious illness in poorer countries, giving mutant strains a toehold to thrive. As of Thursday, less that 24 per cent of people in South Africa had been fully vaccinated, and not even 20 per cent in Botswana, reported Our World in Data. Although the case numbers for identified B.1.1. remain relatively small, the nightmare scenario of it seeping out from Africa is very real. Two cases of the new variant have already emerged in Hong Kong, and one of those individuals has been identified as a person who'd travelled from Canada, the Hong Kong government said Thursday. Herd immunity, achieved by protecting people via vaccines, not exposing them to the pathogen that causes COVID-19, may ultimately save us all, although it's uncertain what percentage of the population must be vaccinated to induce it. Allowing COVID-19 to radiate unchecked would continue to cost lives unnecessarily. Which is why dopey vaccine heretics such as Krista Ford Haynes should shut the frig up.

Alberta government lack of foresight has them stumbling to stave off fourth wave of COVID-19,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-alberta-government-lack-of-foresight-has-them-stumbling-to-stave-off/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"Public-health emergency has forced Jason Kenney, Alberta government’s hand as COVID-19 numbers, lower number of vaccinations creates health care woes",['Kelly Cryderman'],2021-09-03 21:32:53,"Health Minister Tyler Shandro has pointed the finger at Alberta's younger population for one of the causes of the COVID-19 upswing and hospitalizations. But that's not the full story.Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press The Kenney government clearly didn't foresee that COVID-19 would still be a public-health emergency in September, 2021. But here we are. After almost a month of stasis by Alberta's United Conservative Party government on the pandemic file, an alarming increase in COVID-19 cases and hospital admissions - and an accompanying series of elective surgery postponements to maintain capacity in critical care - forced the province's hand. Premier Jason Kenney, who hasn't spoken to reporters since early August, stood Friday to announce a somewhat disjointed suite of temporary measures to try to stem the fourth wave's rising tide. They include a 10 p.m. curfew on serving liquor, a strong recommendation that unvaccinated people avoid big social gatherings, and a provincial mask mandate for indoor public spaces and workplaces as of 8 a.m. Saturday. Most controversially, there's a plan to give still-unvaccinated people a $100 debit card to get their first or second shot. Alberta to offer $100 incentive to encourage vaccination as COVID cases continue to surge With 70 per cent of eligible Albertans having received both of their doses of vaccine already, the argument against such a plan is glaringly obvious. ""Kenney is punishing millions of Albertans who have done the right thing while rewarding those who have not. He's then giving $100 to the very people putting us at risk,"" said NDP Leader Rachel Notley. This $100 incentive is different than the vaccine lottery, which was open to everyone who has been vaccinated, including keeners (and helped ""a bit,"" according to Mr. Kenney on Friday). The Premier made the point that the debit card could go to help a low-income person pay for transportation to get a vaccine. But he also said that he doesn't care, at this point, whether the idea offends anyone's sensibilities - it's about keeping people from developing severe COVID-19 symptoms, and ending up in hospital. ""I wish we didn't have to do this. But this is not a time for moral judgments. This is a time to get people vaccinated,"" Mr. Kenney said. ""We have left no stone unturned, and yet we have the lowest vaccination rate in Canada,"" he added. ""And that is why we're getting hit harder."" Yes, Alberta's immunization rate is lower than other provinces. As Mr. Kenney and Health Minister Tyler Shandro noted many times, that's in part because of the province's younger population. There is also a small but significant group - larger in percentage terms than in most other provinces - who say they will never get a COVID-19 vaccine. But of course, there are other stones unturned, including a vaccine-passport system for entering non-essential businesses, which other provinces are implementing. Some type of system is also proving to be inevitable - at least to some degree - for travel, going to concerts or sporting events and public-facing jobs. (An Alberta vaccine passport system might develop in an ad hoc manner. As proof-of-vaccination is increasingly required by companies, employers and for travel, Alberta is developing proof-of-vaccination documents, including a machine-readable QR code, even if the government is not mandating a vaccine passport) But for a Premier who said this June that Albertans should expect ""maybe even the best summer ever"" and that it was his intention that the province be open for good, this all must have been a huge, difficult pill to swallow. There was little reference to those past declarations on Friday - although Mr. Shandro said ""a more contagious variant means that we need more people vaccinated to finally put this thing behind us - we honestly thought that we'd be there by now."" You could feel the political wrangling that must have taken place in the hours leading up to the Friday announcement. The Premier in the past has disavowed both vaccine passports and forcing people to get vaccinated. He's walking a fine balance of past political pledges to prioritize individual choice and freedom, the support of party members who want no part of new restrictions, and the stark reality of hospital ICUs filling up and more health care workers teetering on the verge of burnout. So many things that this government saw as near certain haven't come to pass. There hasn't been the decoupling of the number of COVID-19 cases from hospital admissions that Chief Medical Officer of Health Deena Hinshaw and her officials talked about in the middle of the summer. And the decision by Alberta Health Services to issue a firm vaccine requirement for its frontline staff this week is certainly not what the Premier and many in his caucus would have wished. But yet his government didn't block that decision, with Mr. Kenney saying it was the prerogative of AHS, a major employer, and that health staff are already required to prove they've been immunized for old-school diseases such as measles and mumps. Mr. Kenney is trying to please a number of camps at once. There's the three-quarters or so of Albertans who support vaccines, vaccine passports and some level of restrictions in order to quell the pandemic. There's also those who deplore any restrictions, and think being vaccinated is a wholly personal and sometimes wrong decision. He is also trying, as he himself acknowledged, to stay out of the federal election campaign. He won't be campaigning in Ontario like he did during the 2019 federal campaign, on behalf of then-Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, because ""given the situation, obviously I'm staying focused here."" But he and other Conservatives have to be worried that Mr. Kenney's diminished brand can influence the federal election, and will be used by the federal Liberals as a means to an end. When Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau came to Calgary last month, he attacked Mr. Kenney. This week, Calgary Skyview Liberal candidate George Chahal tweeted his party's commercial, which shows footage of Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole praising Alberta's handling of the pandemic, shown against unflattering newspaper headlines of Alberta's COVID-19 response. To be clear, all governments are grappling with a long list of terrible unknowns, and choosing from a selection of unpalatable options when it comes to an awful Delta-driven wave of the pandemic. Protesters in Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec have taken to major thoroughfares and hospital entrances in the past week to voice their discontent with vaccine passports. The desired markers for acceptable level of a vaccinated population are changing quickly: For instance, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health said in early August that a 90-per-cent full vaccination rate was an ""aspirational goal."" Now, Kieran Moore said that number is needed to prevent rapid spread in the community. But in Alberta, where ICUs are nearing capacity just as tens of thousands of unvaccinated school kids are back in class, it's astounding that provincial health officials spoke with such certainty about dismantling COVID-19 monitoring systems and legal requirements to isolate this summer. And for Mr. Kenney and his UCP government, it appears they were so intent on moving on from the worst stages of the pandemic, that they have responded too late to better stave off some of the fourth wave's worst impacts on the province's hospitals, and people.

Anti-vaxxers are about to change Canada - with a little help from Justin Trudeau,https://www.thestar.com/politics/political-opinion/2021/11/22/anti-vaxxers-are-about-to-change-canada-with-a-little-help-from-justin-trudeau.html,www.thestar.com,"The throne speech will be first chance for the Liberals to say what they learned about the country on the election trail, Susan Delacourt writes.","['Susan Delacourt', 'National Columnist']",2021-11-22 00:00:00,"Justin Trudeau only really snapped once during the protests that followed him throughout the last election campaign. ""Isn't there a hospital you should be going to bother right now?"" Trudeau shot back at a protester who was shouting slurs against the prime minister's wife during a stop in Surrey, B.C. Not surprisingly then, one of the top items on the government's to-do list in the coming weeks will be a legislated crackdown on protests against hospitals and health-care workers. It is a sign that those ugly protests of the campaign did in fact leave a mark on Trudeau and his government, which is finally getting down to business in Parliament this week with the official speech from the throne to be read on Tuesday. All the attention about the anti-vaccination movement in this country is currently focused on the trouble plaguing Conservatives. It was a drumbeat under all the activity of MPs returning to the Commons on Monday: who was vaccinated in the Conservative caucus and who was not? But during the campaign, anti-vaxxers were a problem for Trudeau as well, and the coming weeks will reveal how much of the government's agenda was shaped by what Liberals saw on the election trail this year. While the throne speech is not expected to contain many surprises - it's reportedly being kept fairly short, too - it is really the first chance for Trudeau and his Liberals to say what they learned about the country while they were out seeking re-election. On that score, the protests were a nasty surprise - a glimpse of an angry, frustrated slice of the population that was looking for someone to blame for all the disruption in their lives. Day after day, the shouting mobs showed up to vent their anger over everything from vaccinations to lockdowns to Trudeau himself. Initially, Trudeau sought to understand the protesters, and to cast them as victims of the damage the pandemic had wrought in many Canadians' lives. But by the time he got to Surrey, the prime minister saw them as a slap in the face to peace, order and good government. They were the kind of people who got in the way of doctors and science. So if the protests do make an appearance between the lines of Tuesday's speech from the throne, it will probably come in the realm of law and order. The measures taken to protect hospital and health-care workers will be one such appearance. Another will be in a promise to tackle online hate speech and disinformation. The federal Liberals already were making moves to curb hate speech before the election campaign, but the protests underlined just how quickly disinformation could spread and become dangerous. So too were all the election signs defaced during the campaign, many of them scrawled with racist or xenophobic slurs. Demonstrators at the anti-Trudeau protests shouted slogans imported directly from disinformation channels online, rife with conspiracy theories on vaccines and the government. If nothing else, this should have put some iron in the Liberal government's spine when it comes to stronger measures against online abuse. The Liberals' platform identified this as one of the priorities for the first 100 days after the election - legislation to combat ""serious forms of harmful online content,"" as well as strengthening the Criminal Code and Canadian Human Rights Act against hate speech. They also promised a ""national action plan"" to combat hate by 2022, which is only six weeks away. A couple of weeks ago, Trudeau spoke to the Paris Peace Forum about the spread of online disinformation and hate, in what might have been a hint about where Canada is headed to combat them. ""There is no doubt the digital space has incredible power for good,"" Trudeau said. ""But from disinformation on vaccines to online extremism, we've also seen the threat it can pose to our democratic values, systems and our citizens. We can't allow the benefits of the digital space to come at the expense of people's rights or safety."" Unfortunately - or fittingly - Trudeau never did get to finish talking about the ""real action"" Canada was taking. His online connection to the forum abruptly cut out, never to be restored, right after the prime minister mentioned the importance of connectivity. Many Liberals are no doubt tempted to see the ugly election protests of 2021 as a distant memory, better forgotten or relegated to the tiny slice of the population who voted for the People's Party of Canada, which failed to win even one seat in the Commons. But even if they don't get a direct mention in Tuesday's relatively brief speech from the throne, they will echo through whatever moves the government makes in the next weeks to contain the forces that drove those demonstrations.

McGill must do more to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks on campus,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-mcgill-must-do-more-to-prevent-covid-outbreaks-on-campus/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"By not requiring vaccination, the university is effectively excluding many immunocompromised students","['Richard Gold', 'Joanne Liu']",2021-09-21 08:00:00,"Richard Gold is a professor in McGill's Faculty of Law and Faculty of Medicine. Joanne Liu is a professor at McGill's School of Population and Global Health. When you look at Canada's biggest universities, McGill is an outlier. The Montreal university has some of the weakest measures for preventing transmission of COVID-19. Where many universities follow best practices and are pro-active in preventing infections on campus and in their communities, McGill has taken the attitude that everything will simply turn out okay. We have seen this story before and it never turns out well. Across Canada, all major universities, except for those in Quebec, have moved to a proof-of-vaccination requirement and are using other measures, such as masking, testing and capacity limits. While no Quebec university has yet implemented a proof-of-vaccination requirement, others have done more to protect their students and faculty by reducing class sizes and allowing faculty to teach online. While McGill requires masks for students in classrooms, they aren't required for faculty while lecturing. Some very large classes have been moved online, but most are still happening in person, and there's no physical distancing in classrooms, some of which are crowded. Instructors are reporting that some rooms have poor ventilation or none at all. Following provincial guidelines, students need proof of vaccination to do extracurricular activities, campus pubs and restaurants and also libraries, but don't need it to enter classrooms. There is no routine testing and communication about outbreaks is inconsistent. McGill had promised students that campus would be safe - not with zero risk but with reasonable risk. Instead, it puts students, such as organ recipients or pregnant women, at even higher risk, even if they are vaccinated. McGill has let down those students and staff and faculty who rely on the university to maintain an adequate level of safety. Nor does Quebec's declaration that its vaccine passport will not apply to higher education as an ""essential"" service impede McGill from implementing its own proof-of-vaccination requirement. For the tiny fraction of students who have a valid health or religious reason to refuse vaccination, frequent negative test results would allow them to remain on campus. For the even tinier fraction of students who simply refuse to be vaccinated, it is possible to maintain access to education through online options and classroom recordings. McGill's current policy effectively excludes many students: the immunocompromised, those with underlying health conditions and those who care for people at risk. The university is doing this in order to preserve the ability of those who choose not to be vaccinated and who have no valid medical or religious exemption to attend the university. Looking at statistics from the United States, this latter group is extremely small. In the entire University of Virginia, which has a student population of more than 27,000, the number of students not permitted to enroll because of lack of vaccination this fall was 49. One of McGill's contentions is that it cannot adopt a proof-of-vaccination requirement because Quebec law prohibits it. Yet not only have 35 of its own law professors and instructors said otherwise, but the rector of the Universite de Montreal, Daniel Jutras, acknowledged as much. There is no law or human rights provision that prevents the university, in a time of declared pandemic, from bringing in the same common-sense requirements that virtually every other major Canadian and U.S. university has implemented. If McGill truly believed that the law prevents it from acting, then one would expect it to argue with the province to reverse this law. Instead, McGill, in a submission with all other universities in the province, argued before a National Assembly committee that the government should not require universities to require proof of vaccination. That is, the university is lobbying against the single health measure that its own School of Population and Global Health said was key to fighting COVID-19. There is no doubt that figuring out how to implement measures fairly and within budget is a challenge. But the fact is that other major Canadian universities have already done so. Those universities are reporting great success. Since bringing in its proof-of-vaccination requirement, the University of Western Ontario reported that 98 per cent of its students are now vaccinated. McGill estimates that 86 per cent of its students are vaccinated. This means that in a typical class of 100 students, there are 14 unvaccinated students, compared with only two at Western. By falling behind other major universities, McGill is putting its most vulnerable at risk. It is refusing to put common sense and public-health evidence into practice. It needs to do more or vulnerable people will be harmed on its campus. Keep your Opinions sharp and informed. Get the Opinion newsletter. Sign up today."
Families should not have to choose between COVID-19 and flu vaccinations for children,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2021/12/06/families-should-not-have-to-choose-between-covid-19-and-flu-vaccinations-for-children.html,www.thestar.com,"Enforcing rigid rules around vaccination timing has potentially harmful consequences, write Andrea Chittle, Holly Witteman and Sabina Vohra-Miller.","['Andrea Chittle', 'Holly Witteman', 'Sabina Vohra-Miller']",2021-12-06 00:00:00,"Consider a multi-generational family - both parents working essential roles. The family is looking forward to booking appointments for the six and eight-year-old children, who will be the last in the household to get COVID-19 vaccines. The whole family also plans to get annual flu shots next Saturday. Unfortunately, where they live, they have been told that they cannot get a COVID-19 vaccine within two weeks of another vaccine. So, they delay their influenza vaccines. Choosing between protection against COVID-19 and the flu is not a choice parents should have to make, but unfortunately many families are facing this decision. Some jurisdictions have rigidly implemented the National Advisory Committee on Immunization's suggestion that COVID-19 vaccines for children be given at least 14 days prior to or after other vaccines. The rationale for this ""precautionary"" guidance is to collect clean adverse event data, allowing Health Canada to identify the cause of any rare side effects more confidently. This guidance is not related to concerns about the safety or effectiveness of giving COVID-19 vaccines at the same time as other vaccines. Collecting high-quality data is an important public health objective. However, it is difficult to justify prioritizing data quality over other important considerations regarding vaccine timing when we already have an abundance of COVID-19 vaccine safety data. The same guidance about timing does not exist for people in other age groups in Canada, or for children in the United States, where nearly five million children have received a COVID-19 vaccine. When individual decisions could negatively impact others, public health mandates may reasonably override personal preferences. However, a fundamental goal of public health programs should be supporting people to make valid informed decisions that protect individual and community health. When this goal is not being met, or when public health goals that aren't relevant to most people are being given highest priority, then we should pause to consider whether we are heading in the right direction. We are calling on provincial public health leaders to provide clear and flexible guidance that enables consideration of individual contexts and empowers people to make decisions informed by the best available evidence. Enforcing rigid rules around vaccination timing for children has predictable and potentially harmful consequences. As the winter holiday break approaches, it is clear that timely vaccination against influenza and COVID-19 are both public health priorities. Regrettably, we are learning of many parents and guardians who have cancelled or postponed influenza vaccine appointments so that their children can receive COVID-19 vaccines. As a result, children may not have the best available protection against influenza heading into the winter holiday season. This puts children and families at unnecessary risk of influenza. School-aged children have the highest rates of COVID-19 infection in many parts of Canada. Yet, delays to COVID-19 vaccination are being imposed on children who recently received other vaccines. This means that children and families are being asked to delay getting some protection from COVID-19. In addition, some children have missed routine vaccinations during the pandemic. Prohibiting co-administration and close spacing of vaccines might interfere with catch-up. Finally, children who are afraid of needles and families who have difficulty attending medical appointments shouldn't have to book multiple visits. Logistical challenges and health-care capacity concerns mean that COVID-19 vaccines might not be accessible in all clinical settings. However, in the absence of concerns about safety and effectiveness, whenever possible, decisions that increase comfort, convenience and uptake should be supported by public health systems. At the provincial and territorial level, public health leaders can support flexible and uniform practices across regions by issuing more nuanced recommendations. Instead of universally denying children COVID-19 vaccine appointments within 14 days of other vaccines, informed discussions should be standard practice. Parents and guardians should be given clear information about the justification for vaccine spacing recommendations. The Canadian Paediatric Society's guidance that ""COVID-19 vaccines be offered simultaneously with other required vaccines unless there is assurance that timely administration of other vaccines will not be compromised"" should also be shared with them. Parents and guardians can then consider what matters to them when they schedule vaccination appointments. In important ways, Canada's vaccination campaign has been successful - more than 75 per cent of Canada's residents have been fully vaccinated. However, the journey has been bumpy. Repeatedly, the enforcement of inflexible rules has impeded evidence-informed co-decision-making. This has resulted in barriers and delays to vaccination, as well as pernicious and persistent confusion about vaccine safety among health-care providers and patients. An overemphasis on one-size-fits-all approaches has meant that some people have been left behind. For instance, in the early days, individuals who were pregnant or had particular health conditions were turned away from vaccination clinics. This was based on cautious guidance from NACI, which flagged a lack of clinical data in some groups. NACI recommended case-by-case discussions that considered the risks and benefits of vaccination for individuals who might be at higher risk of getting COVID-19 because of their jobs or might be at higher risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19 because of pregnancy or health conditions. In many places, these conversations didn't take place. Instead, blanket prohibitions against vaccination were enforced. This resulted in very real delays to protection. Inflexible processes deprive people of the opportunity to understand the balance of risks and benefits and make evidence-informed decisions according to what matters to them. Such approaches create barriers and can contribute to vaccine hesitancy and suboptimal vaccine uptake. We are calling for more nuanced guidelines that clearly and plainly articulate risks, benefits, unknowns and expert opinions. We are calling for more flexible implementation processes that meet people where they are and empower people to make evidence-informed, personally relevant decisions.

California has vaccine mandates for settings like schools, hospitals and long-term care homes, and some municipalities have additional rules. Canadian provinces are also rethinking their own proof-of-vaccination policies.PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images Nik Nanos is the chief data scientist at Nanos Research, a global fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, a research professor at the State University of New York in Buffalo and the official pollster for The Globe and Mail and CTV News. There's a new complication to deal with in our schools, workplaces and public gathering spaces: what to do about the willfully unvaccinated. For people who could get vaccinated but are either hesitant or resistant, their personal choice to abstain is impinging on the opinion of the majority. Self-isolation, physical distancing and telework have acted like buffers, allowing social interactions to remain cordial between friends and family members with differing opinions. However, as efforts begin to return to some form of normalcy, those buffers are thinning out. A recent survey by Nanos suggests that there is strong support to require proof of vaccination in a number of settings, but the majority of Canadians are ""social avoiders"" when it comes to disagreements with the other side. Asked what they would do if a good friend disagreed as to whether people should get vaccinated, the top response was to avoid the topic of vaccinations and continue to hang out (46 per cent), while another 34 per cent said they would avoid seeing the friend in person but remain friends. A little less than one in 20 would stop being friends (4 per cent).

However, as private citizens, very substantial majorities of Canadians want to drop the vaccination hammer and are uneasy about stepping into places where people are not fully vaccinated. They want proof of vaccination to engage in activities such as travel and large-scale sporting or arts events. The return to schools in September will see the first wave of vaccination challenges, heightened by the fact that children under 12 do not have the option of getting vaccinated. Research suggests that about seven in 10 Canadians are uncomfortable (45 per cent) or somewhat uncomfortable (26 per cent) sending students to school if some teachers are not fully vaccinated. Perceptions are directly related to age. About 55 per cent of Canadians under 34 years of age are uncomfortable to one degree or another. This discomfort jumps to 84 per cent among those 55 and over. The vaccination appetite for teachers also extends to students. More than six in 10 Canadians (64 per cent) are not keen on sending students in person if some students are not fully vaccinated. The key takeaway is that the desire for action includes both teachers and students. When it comes to other public settings, the concern about returning to in-person interactions where folks might not be vaccinated remains significant. More than seven in 10 people are uncomfortable (48 per cent) or somewhat uncomfortable (25 per cent) visiting a hospital if some health care workers are not fully vaccinated, and two of three Canadians would have some concern showing up to work if colleagues are not fully vaccinated. Proof of vaccinations would be welcome by very strong majorities of Canadians.

The challenge for public-health officials is that the silent majority of people are more likely to prefer avoiding conflict with their unvaccinated friends, neighbours and co-workers. In politics, the squeaky wheel gets the attention. This explains why some politicians have been hesitant to take a hard position on the minority group choosing to be unvaccinated. On the one hand, there is a minority that feels the pressure to be vaccinated and sees their freedom of choice under siege. On the other hand is the silent majority that feels the unvaccinated are a risk to their, or their children's, health and freedom. Most Canadians have indicated that they would rather avoid conflict on this very touchy topic. A paltry 4 per cent of Canadians said they would discuss vaccinations with a good friend if there was a disagreement. But the research shows that they would welcome a harder position by health authorities and politicians. Is choice a valid consideration in the development of vaccination policy? Yes. Does the freedom to not be vaccinated automatically override the public good? No. Our social contract as citizens is based on the recognition of a diversity of opinion but within the context of the broader public good. One's right to throw a punch ends where the other person's nose begins. Setting aside individuals who have medical reasons to be unvaccinated, the consequences of remaining unvaccinated should be clear. Canadians understand that vaccinations help manage the spread of the virus and minimize the seriousness of any future infection. As the path to normalcy gets slowed because of surges in infections and hospitalizations primarily among the unvaccinated, the patience of Canadians might start to wear thin with loved ones, friends and neighbours who have not been voluntarily vaccinated - and our politicians who resist taking a stand. Our political leaders should take note of the views of Canadians. Very strong majorities support proof of vaccination for travel and large gatherings. Many Canadians are uncomfortable with the risk of being exposed to unvaccinated individuals whether it be at school or in hospitals. They are looking for leadership to spare them from the uncomfortable conversations. Notes on the data This column was based on a survey sponsored by Nanos Research.

Opinion: Surgery cancellations are an unbearable burden for all,https://leaderpost.com/opinion/opinion-surgery-cancellations-are-an-unbearable-burden-for-all,leaderpost.com,"We must stop using surgery cancellations as a tool to cope with preventable COVID surges, writes Dr. Ivar Mendez.",['Dr. Ivar Mendez'],2021-10-06 00:00:00,"It seems a lifetime ago that we were facing the second COVID-19 wave when the numbers of COVID cases, hospitalizations and ICU admissions were rapidly increasing in Saskatchewan. At that time, we had no vaccines, and had just gone thru a three-month period when more than 11,000 non-urgent surgeries were postponed. I wrote then advocating for the implementation of proven public health measures to mitigate COVID-19 transmission and avoid overwhelming the health-care system . We are now facing that dreaded scenario with our hospitals overwhelmed, our ICUs full and the acute health-care system near collapse. The blanket cancellation of non-urgent surgical procedures to provide COVID surge capacity, for the second time, has devastating and long-lasting consequences for surgical care in our province. The reallocation of resources to cope with COVID admissions at the expense of surgical care has created new ""COVID victims"" as patients in need of surgery have their care postponed. The standard of surgical care has also been affected. Entire programs such as the organ donation and transplantation services have been placed on hold . Patients requiring cardiac surgery have their care delayed because of lack of ICU beds. There are challenges to provide surgery to cancer patients because there are no beds for their postoperative recovery. Joint replacements, cataract surgery and other so called ""elective"" surgeries are indefinitely postponed, resulting in prolonged pain, suffering and decreased function. The surgical backlog in Saskatchewan has ballooned to more than 33,000 patients waiting for surgery. The postponement of these surgeries causes cumulative harm and disability down the road. For example, it is well established that patients on long waiting lists that need total joint replacement lose function that cannot be fully regained after surgery. This back-breaking buildup will take several years and millions of dollars to clear up. Vaccination is crucial to curb COVID infections, reduce hospitalizations and decrease community transmission. Timely institution of public health measures to fight the pandemic is the responsibility of our elected officials, but we all have a personal responsibility to get vaccinated, wear masks and comply with public health directives. The health of our fellow citizens depends on our actions. Recovery strategies to safely maintain surgical volumes during and immediately after COVID outbreaks need to be instituted. Preservation of our experienced surgical teams should be a priority. Especially vulnerable are operating room and recovery room nurses who have had a high rate of attrition during the pandemic. Optimization of surgical capacity across the province by providing surgery in different surgical units regardless of the patient's place of residence. Maintaining COVID-free surgical units that can function independently of COVID surges should also be considered. COVID-19 and its variants will be with us for the foreseeable future; we must stop using surgery cancellations as a tool to cope with preventable COVID surges. To get over the onslaught of this fourth wave, we need the prompt implementation of ""circuit breaker"" measures. We cannot continue to fight COVID at the expense of surgical care ignoring the needs of tens of thousands of patients that require surgical interventions. Dr. Ivar Mendez is the head of surgery for the University of Saskatchewan and the Saskatchewan Health Authority.

COVID-19 vaccine mandates could offer something unexpected to the hesitant: relief,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-vaccine-mandates-could-offer-something-unexpected-to-the-hesitant/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"For the genuinely vaccine-hesitant who have been paralyzed by the ‘what ifs,’ there might be some strange comfort in having the choice taken out of their hands",['Robyn Urback'],2021-08-13 07:00:00,"Quebec Health Minister Christian Dube shows an app on his phone as he announces details of the COVID-19 vaccination passport system during a news conference on Aug. 10. Mr. Dube said unvaccinated people in Quebec will be denied access to non-essential public spaces such as bars, restaurants and gyms as of Sept. 1.Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press To those who are militantly anti-vaccination, libertarians keen on rhetorical flourish and/or People's Party leader Maxime Bernier (excuse the tautology), a vaccine passport system will inevitably lead to many wretched things: authoritarianism, oppression, medical apartheid, hellfire, brimstones and possibly the slaying of firstborn sons. But to the vaccine-hesitant - that is, those who have held off on COVID-19 vaccination because of genuine reservations about safety or efficacy - a vaccine passport system may inadvertently deliver something else: relief. That's because the requirement to get vaccinated to participate in normal life in effect takes the decision out of individuals' hands. Of course, no one will be pinned down and forcibly injected with Bill Gates's secret soup, but a certificate system would function to shift the perception of choice. Yes to vaccine mandates. Yes to vaccine passports Vaccine mandates are not a hill to die on - literally or figuratively Until now, there have been few tangible repercussions for delaying vaccination (other than that whole ""major increased risk of serious illness and death"" thing), meaning that the vaccine-hesitant had little impetus to go out and get their shots. If they opted to receive their vaccines and something went wrong - a serious adverse reaction, for example - they'd be left with the nagging thought that there was no one to blame but themselves. Why did they take the risk, they might wonder, if they didn't have to? But vaccine mandates serve to limit that perception of complete autonomy. The decision is ultimately still left to the individual, but it becomes easier to justify getting the vaccine on account of the province, or the federal government, or the school or employer, leaving ""no choice"" but to do so. Indeed, a requirement to get vaccinated to attend, say, in-person classes at the University of Ottawa, or a Jets game in Winnipeg, shifts the burden onto the state or institution, and gives the vaccine-hesitant someone to blame if something goes wrong. That knowledge alone can relieve some of the stress of deciding whether to schedule a shot. Psychologist Barry Schwartz wrote about this phenomenon in his book The Paradox of Choice, where he discusses the toll that ""overchoice"" can have on the psyche. His thesis is essentially that too many choices - or the perception of many choices - can cause negative effects, including ""anticipated regret"" (""you can actually experience regret in anticipation of making a decision,"" he writes). Mr. Schwartz explains that the desire to avoid regret can sometimes cause a sort of paralysis - ""inaction inertia,"" he calls it - whereby people who are presented with too many choices simply avoid making a decision at all out of fear of making the wrong one and later experiencing regret. ""The more that our experiences result from our own choices,"" he explains further, ""the more regret we will feel if things don't turn out as we had hoped."" Vaccine mandates would directly challenge that inaction inertia. Vaccine-hesitant Canadians who might have previously been paralyzed by an abundance of choice (should I start conducting in-person lectures and see how things go? Or maybe do only half of my lectures on campus? Perhaps I'll just wear a mask? What if I just get one shot?) are suddenly given very limited options: Get vaccinated, or stay off campus. No longer can their experience be seen as the product of wholly autonomous choice, which can actually relieve their anxiety about potentially making the wrong one: I had no choice; I had to get vaccinated - and if this ends badly, it's the university's fault. Various studies have shown that people actually tend to experience greater satisfaction with their decisions when given limited choices, which might indicate that we don't exactly trust ourselves when it comes to selecting from an abundance of options. One of the most cited studies was conducted by American academics Sheena Iyengar and Mark Lepper in 2000, when they looked at how inclined shoppers were to purchase jars of jam when they got to sample from a table of 24 varieties, versus one of six varieties. In the end, 30 per cent of tasters purchased from the table of limited options, compared to just three per cent of those who sampled from the table of 24 varieties. The researchers noted that ""as the attractiveness of alternatives rises, individuals experience conflict and as a result tend to defer decision, search for new alternatives, choose the default option, or simply opt not to choose."" The stakes are higher, obviously, when choosing how, when, and why to receive two shots in the arm of a new vaccine than they are when choosing between rhubarb and blackberry jam. But it follows that if individuals struggle to trust their own judgment in selecting from myriad options of jams, they would also experience all sorts of complex emotions, anticipated regret, and inaction inertia when deciding if and when to get vaccinated. Vaccine mandates serve to relieve that burden by limiting the choices to just a few jars of jam, so to speak. While that might signal the start of creeping authoritarianism to those staunchly anti-vaccination, to the vaccine-hesitant - and everyone else looking hoping for better vaccine coverage across the country - it can offer invaluable mental reprieve.

"Despite Doug Ford, vaccine mandates are progressing in Ontario, and giving us hope",https://www.thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/2021/10/21/despite-doug-ford-vaccine-mandates-are-progressing-in-ontario-and-giving-us-hope.html,www.thestar.com,"Police, hospitals and even federal MPs are subject to mandates — and they’ve been shown to work.",['Bruce Arthur'],2021-10-21 00:00:00,"Of course hospitals should have a vaccine mandate. It's one of those statements that is so obvious it almost shouldn't be a discussion; it's like debating whether samosas are great, or whether dirt bikes are fun, or whether Toronto has become an amalgam of unaffordable real estate and jam-packed dangerous roads, with inadequate transit. It's just what it is. And as society clambers toward what might be the next world, vaccine mandates are being established as guardrails, if not often by the government. Ontario did already mandate vaccines in long-term care. But developments are accelerating: federal MPs now have to be vaccinated, with the federal Conservatives the lone objectors to the policy; the CBC is among the companies who have announced staff need to be vaccinated, too. As the Star's Wendy Gillis reports, the Toronto Police Service has set a Nov. 30 deadline, with unpaid leave if an officer refuses. It's a refreshing change of pace, contemplating actual consequences for police decisions. And then there are hospitals. Hospitals care for the sick, the elderly, the immunocompromised. They should be fully vaccinated environments. Many in Ontario have established their own vaccine mandates as the province dithered. And it's working. In Ottawa, CTV reported 318 employees out of about 12,000 were threatened with unpaid leave this week, in advance of a Nov. 1 deadline, and 129 already had one dose of a vaccine. At Sick Kids in Toronto the number is 145, or 1.8 per cent of its 8,258 employees, and the hospital said it did not anticipate any service disruptions. Earlier this month, Windsor Hospital fired or revoked the privileges of 57 staffers out of 4,155. And as the Star's Megan Ogilvie reports, University Health Network, the largest hospital group in the country, estimates as of Thursday between 18 and 200 people remained unvaccinated out of 17,200 employees. The remaining staffers will be given one more chance, after the hospital convened dozens of town halls and educational sessions, to give staff every chance to appreciate the facts. And if they refuse the last chance, they will be fired. Some 70 per cent of Ontario's hospitals have a mandate, and have seen a marked reduction in vaccine-hesitant employees. Mandates have worked elsewhere, too. They've worked in the United States, where vaccine hesitancy is a cultural issue that will ensure continued infection. Alberta has the highest vaccine hesitancy rate of any province in Canada, and when Alberta Health Services mandated vaccines, 61 out of 108,000 staff refused. And this is how it has to be. Yes, you could probably implement the same approximate level of safety with daily rapid testing, but that creates an entire architecture of cost and time when vaccination is easier and more societally beneficial. Yes, education and outreach should be a required part of the process, because for almost everyone the benefits of vaccines will outweigh any risks. ""The problem is sometimes when we focus on harm, we lose sight of the benefits,"" says Dr. David Juurlink, the head of clinical pharmacology and toxicology at Sunnybrook hospital, and a drug safety researcher. ""A vaccine is a drug, and anytime a doctor prescribes a drug or a patient decides to take a drug, there really is only one reason they should do so. And that reason is because they believe that the potential benefits exceed the potential harms. ""The last two patients I saw weren't vaccinated. And both of them had COVID. And I asked them why they weren't vaccinated, and they said, we're worried about blood clots. And these were people who were in their late 50s or 60s. They focused on the safety concerns, and hadn't gotten them right - clots were an (AstraZeneca) issue. But they also hadn't considered the essential benefits. And boy, these vaccines, the degree to which they protect us, not just from getting infected but from landing in hospital or in the ICU or dying, is really quite extraordinary."" Again, Ontario's data is unequivocal. Vaccines protect you, and the people around you. There is room to assess relative effectiveness regarding dose interval, regarding declining efficacy, and regarding third-shot boosters. We should pay close attention to myocarditis, especially in men under 30, even if the vast majority of cases seem to resolve quickly. We will continue to learn about both the long-term effects of the virus, and of the vaccines. But based on the information we have now, with well over three billion doses of vaccine administered worldwide, vaccines have almost become a test of your ability to rationally assess objective reality. It's why lost souls like MPP Randy Hillier - who this week falsely linked some actual deaths to vaccination, infuriating several grieving families, before deleting the post and refusing to apologize - have to invent imaginary, anecdotal evidence. It's a gruesome way to live. ""It's not even about a person's wrong-headed decision to not vaccinate yourself,"" says Juurlink. ""It's what that says about a person's ability to make rational judgments, when they're faced with reasonably concrete information."" Vaccine mandates are simple, in that way. You wouldn't want to be policed by an officer who lacks both that critical risk assessment, or the empathy to protect the community he or she serves. Same with a politician. Same with a doctor or a nurse. A vaccine mandate doesn't force anyone to take a highly protective vaccine. It forces people to make a choice about fulfilling their basic job requirements, individually and societally. So yes, Ontario will probably trudge to mandating the last 30 per cent of health care, weeks after health care did most of the work. Premier Doug Ford asked for opinions on the subject, and has received endorsements from the Ontario Hospital Association, the council of medical officers of health, and the province's independent volunteer science table. It's because it was obvious. It should probably also be a start. The way out of this damned stupid interminable pandemic is as many vaccines as we can deliver, anywhere we can. And mandates work.

U.S. President Donald Trump claimed, ""The World Health Organization just admitted that I was right. Lockdowns are killing countries all over the world. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself."" That's only kinda, sorta right. David Nabarro, the WHO's special envoy on COVID, told Britain's Spectator magazine, ""We really do appeal to all world leaders: stop using lockdown as your primary control method."" Of course, the WHO is also against travel bans and was initially against masks, so maybe they're not a great authority. However, the reason WHO is against lockdowns is not because lockdowns are scientifically or medically useless. The WHO's opposition is politically correct. ""Lockdowns just have one consequence that you must never, ever belittle,"" Dr. Nabarro went on, ""and that is making poor people an awful lot poorer."" I am opposed to re-entering lockdowns to try to protect Canadians against a second wave of coronavirus, but not necessarily for the same reasons as Nabarro. I am against lockdowns because in Canada they are enormously costly economically and, more importantly, unjustified by the science. Take Ontario Premier Doug Ford's decision Tuesday to close restaurants, bars and gyms in Toronto, Ottawa and the Peel region for the next month. It is based solely on political nervousness over the raw numbers of infections and not on a solid, scientific analysis of the threat posed by the virus. Yes, Ford's province has had the highest new-case numbers in the country, but it is also home to almost 40% of all Canadians. It's no surprise Ontario's numbers are the highest in the land. Yet even these raw numbers aren't all that bad. Over the past seven days, Ontario has recorded 32 new cases per 10,000 population. That's one-third of one per cent of the population. Compare that to Quebec's rate of 90 per 10,000. (Alberta is at about 25 and B.C. at about 12.) Also, the nature of who is getting COVID has changed. Now in most provinces, between two-thirds and three-quarters of new infectees are under 40, a segment of the population that is unlikely to become very sick (unless they have two or three underlying conditions). Yes, protect the most vulnerable. Keep them away from infected individuals. But what is the point of a massive lockdown or even widespread business closures if most of those infected are not getting severely ill? There are between 3,000 and 6,000 flu deaths a year in Canada. We don't shut down schools, businesses, factories, malls and restaurants for that. This past weekend, Quebec even had police patrolling the streets in Montreal and Quebec City making sure no one invited friends into their home for Thanksgiving. That put me in mind of Oliver Cromwell's patrols in Puritan England in the 17th Century. Laws had been passed forbidding the celebration of Christmas, so government agents walked the streets and rode down country lanes seizing festive treats. The numbers to watch closely are hospitalization and ICU numbers. And while overall raw numbers have been rising, hospitalization rates haven't come close to the levels from spring. And weren't lockdowns then designed to slow the spread mostly so hospitals didn't become overburdened? So, if our hospitals aren't becoming overburdened now, what's the justification for renewed lockdowns? I prefer Alberta's most relaxed response. Even though Alberta has seen a doubling of raw numbers since late September, Alberta's government merely encouraged residents to keep Thanksgiving dinners under 15 people and take ""personal responsibility"" to keep one another healthy.

Ottawa needs to step up and finish the job on vaccine passports,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2021/10/07/ottawa-needs-to-step-up-and-finish-the-job-on-vaccine-passports.html,www.thestar.com,‘If Ottawa wants to make life easier and more pleasant for the more than 80 per cent of Canadians who have done the right thing by getting fully vacci...,['Star Editorial Board'],2021-10-07 00:00:00,"Hundreds of thousands of federal workers, as well as anyone over 12 who wants to fly or take a train in Canada, will have to be fully vaccinated in the coming weeks. The measures laid out on Wednesday allow for few exceptions and leave no doubt as to where the Liberal government stands on the principle of COVID-19 immunization: it's a public good and core federal workers and travellers must comply, or else. This sends an important signal to other jurisdictions, institutions and businesses that are still grappling with vaccine requirements and deciding who should be covered. This week Toronto, along with provinces from B.C. to Nova Scotia, ratcheted up their own get-vaxxed-or-else policies for a range of workers. Pressure will keep mounting, as it should, on the Ford government in Ontario, which has only tiptoed into the waters of mandatory vaccination. Vaccine mandates work. They increase takeup, especially for those sitting on the fence. They help prevent the spread of COVID, save lives and tottering health care systems, and increase the odds that schools and businesses will stay open. The federal government is, as Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland bluntly put it, making sure ""a minority of people cannot sabotage Canada's economic recovery."" But if the government intends to do more than that, if it wants to make life easier and more pleasant for the more than 80 per cent of Canadians who have done the right thing by getting fully vaccinated, then the job is not yet done. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canadians who rolled up their sleeves for COVID jabs ""don't deserve to be slowed down in their desire to travel and face more onerous tasks."" We couldn't agree more. So where is the national COVID passport? All those who can now enjoy safer travel because of the vaccine requirement should be able to easily flash their standardized vaccination credentials with an internationally recognized QR code. Like vaccine mandates for federal workers and travellers, the Trudeau government promised a national vaccine passport just days before it triggered the federal election. But, unlike mandates, it's still nowhere in sight. What Canadians have now is a patchwork of proof-of-vaccine systems, depending on the province they happen to live in. People in Quebec, for example, have had an app since Sept. 1 while those in Ontario are using paper documents (and easily forged ones to boot) for at least another two weeks until the province's personalized QR code and verification app makes an appearance. When asked about a standardized national passport or app, Trudeau had lots to say about provincial jurisdiction over health care and health information and very little about an actual delivery date. ""In the weeks to come we'll get the job done on a vaccine passport for international travel,"" he said earlier. It better be weeks and not dragging into months. It's already long overdue. If Europe can figure this out across national borders - and it did months ago - surely Canada can manage to navigate provincial ones. Beyond that, Ottawa needs to do more for Canadians who received a mixed-dose regime of COVID-19 vaccinations and may be barred from travel to jurisdictions, most notably the U.S., because of it. Those people, some 3.9 million of them, accepted the first vaccine they were offered. They did what Ottawa asked of them and the government has a responsibility to make sure they don't pay a price for that now. The Trudeau government promised vaccine mandates for federal workers and travellers and it has delivered. Now we need a national vaccine passport. The vast majority of Canadians have done the right thing for themselves and others by getting their jabs. It shouldn't be too much to expect Ottawa and the provinces to get their act together and produce the ""easily recognized and trusted"" document that proves what they've done."
Omicron variant shows we’re stuck in a perverse ‘Groundhog Day’-esque loop,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2021/12/05/omicron-variant-shows-were-stuck-in-a-perverse-groundhog-day-esque-loop.html,www.thestar.com,"It’s extremely frustrating: we know what will help further limit the spread of COVID, yet we’ve chosen the same playbook as if it were March 2020.","['Supriya Dwivedi', 'Contributing Columnist']",2021-12-05 00:00:00,"Canadians were reminded once again that irrespective of our high vaccination rate and ensuing cautious optimism, this pandemic is not over. Nearly two years in, we still do not seem to collectively understand that this pandemic will not truly end until the vast majority of the world is inoculated against COVID-19, and/or we get transmission rates under control. Currently, we have neither. Transmission of the virus is still rampant. Vaccine uptake in much of the developed world is far from where it should be. The self-interested - and ultimately self-defeating - practice of wealthy nations engaging in vaccine hoarding has left much of the rest of the world without even a first dose. South African scientists did the entire world an enormous service by first identifying the variant now known as Omicron, and then the world - including Canada - decided to pay them back by instituting a reactionary blanket travel ban, directly disincentivizing future reporting of new variants. According to Tulio de Oliveira, director of the Network for Genomics Surveillance in South Africa, that blanket travel ban is now likely going to cause one of the world's leading centres for genomic surveillance and phylogenetic analysis a shortage of the reagents needed to conduct the very analyses many other countries are incapable of doing. You can't find what you're not looking for. Unsurprisingly, once the rest of the world started looking for Omicron, they started to find it. Yet Canada's travel ban is currently limited to the African continent. We know that Omicron isn't solely relegated to the countries that Canada has decided to restrict travel from, and yet we're still playing this weird game nearly two years into the pandemic. Limited border closures like the one Canada has imposed are not some magical panacea. Border closures can buy you time, but these measures alone are not going to save us, especially when we refuse to openly acknowledge that the American border continues to pose one of the biggest risks to us. As Andrew Joseph reported for STAT, there is evidence that there was ""at least some local transmission of the Omicron variant and that it had arrived in the U.S. before the Biden administration imposed travel restrictions."" The community transmission there indicates that ""the variant was in the United States even before the global research community knew about the threat the variant potentially posed."" That doesn't mean there is no hope and that we should hide under a pile of coats for the foreseeable future. We have safe and effective vaccines, and drug makers seem confident at their ability to be able to churn out an Omicron-specific vaccine, should it be deemed necessary. We also have promising therapeutics that can be used for treatment purposes. But it's extremely frustrating that we know what will help further limit the spread of COVID, including Omicron, and we just refuse to do it. We need public health and infection prevention and control (IPAC) leaders to acknowledge that COVID is spread through the air, not just through droplets. Canada should be emulating countries like France and have clear guidance on air quality control measures. Instead of continuing with the theatrics of deep cleaning surfaces and putting up Plexiglas barriers everywhere, we should be imploring the public to upgrade to better masks. And we should be handing out rapid tests like surplus Halloween candy, making them widely and readily available to every single person, business and organization that wants them. Yet we've chosen the same basic playbook as if it were March 2020.

An angry public is forcing timid governments to get tough with COVID-19 vaccine resisters,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-an-angry-public-is-forcing-timid-governments-to-get-tough-with-vaccine/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"Increasingly, we are seeing companies, fed up with government reluctance to move on mandates, go it alone",['Gary Mason'],2021-08-26 13:27:01,"B.C. provincial health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, puts on her mask after releasing details about a COVID-19 vaccination card that will be needed by anyone wanting to eat in restaurants, visit theatres or go to other events, on Aug. 23, 2021.CHAD HIPOLITO/The Canadian Press A few months ago, B.C.'s Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, was asked about her view on vaccine passports. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, Dr. Henry has been a fierce advocate for the most vulnerable. She has talked about how the pandemic has not only exposed the gross inequities in our society but exacerbated them. It's why she was reluctant to support a broad mandatory masking policy in the early days of the crisis - she felt it might discriminate against society's weakest. How, it was never exactly clear. Eventually, however, the public grew increasingly tired of this stance, and demanded the government introduce greater public-health protections. Dr. Henry's hand was forced. Fast-forward a year, late May, 2021, and Dr. Henry is asked at a news conference for her position on vaccine passports. Absolutely not, she said, again worried that it would somehow worsen inequities. ""It would not be my advice that we have any sort of vaccine passport ... for services in B.C.,"" she told reporters. Canada vaccine tracker: How many COVID-19 doses have been administered so far? Coronavirus tracker: How many COVID-19 cases are there in Canada and worldwide? The latest maps and charts Three months later, Dr. Henry was back in front of reporters, talking about the need for, you guessed it, vaccine passports. She said the ""science"" around COVID-19 - unvaccinated people are at 10 times a higher risk of contracting the disease than those who are inoculated - justified the move. More likely, it was a frustrated and angry citizenry. A day later, Dr. Henry would announce that because of rising COVID-19 numbers, masks would once again be mandatory in all indoor spaces. This, mere days after she was filmed maskless at a football game taking selfies with dozens of maskless fans. We draw attention to these decisions not to expose contradictions in Dr. Henry's policy decisions - although there have been some real head-scratchers - but rather to highlight the degree to which our political and public-health decision-makers have made decisions that should have been taken much, much earlier. And mostly because the public forced them to. While this has been the case almost from the outset of the pandemic, there is one difference now: the mood of the public has really turned. There is increasingly little tolerance for the mollycoddling on display toward the vaccine-hesitant, the ones prolonging a full recovery from the crisis. That's why in the case of B.C. and provinces such as Quebec and Manitoba, governments have made a move on passports. Those of us who are vaccinated, the majority, have had it with the resisters. If the unvaccinated can do everything the rest of us can, where is the incentive to change, to get a shot? Still, governments and public-health officials aren't doing enough. There is enormous frustration, for instance, over the fact Dr. Henry, and by extension the B.C. government, remains reluctant to introduce vaccine mandates among a wider array of groups. Why not K-12 teachers? Even the teachers' union in B.C. has now said it wouldn't oppose a mandate. Why not university students? The government has said universities can require employees, including professors, to get vaccinated, but not the students who fill their classrooms. Think about it: the government is requiring people provide proof of vaccination to enter a restaurant, bar or gym, but not a classroom. That's ridiculous. The government has instituted a vaccine mandate for long-term care and assisted living workers, but not hospitals generally. This also makes no sense. We know the stick works. Since the B.C. government announced the vaccine passport system, registrations for inoculations have shot up. The same thing has happened in other jurisdictions where mandates or passports have been introduced. . In Alberta, the NHL Calgary Flames and CFL Stampeders have announced fans will have to show proof of vaccination to attend games - in defiance of the Alberta government's position on the issue. Premier Jason Kenney doesn't believe in mandates, presumably because they are an infringement on people's civil rights. Again, sheer nonsense. But he's not the only premier to fall into this category. Saskatchewan is a mandate resister and so is Ontario. But they will eventually cave if the fourth wave continues to wreak havoc, and if citizens in those provinces see how the stick has worked elsewhere in levelling the latest virus surge. There will be many books and academic examinations of governments' responses to the pandemic. And those investigations will undoubtedly show that in many instances, authorities lagged public opinion badly. Consequently, they allowed the greatest public-health crisis of our lives to drag on far longer than it needed to. Keep your Opinions sharp and informed. Get the Opinion newsletter. Sign up today."
"If the COVID-19 pandemic isn’t an emergency demanding real leadership, what is?",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-if-the-covid-19-pandemic-isnt-an-emergency-demanding-real-leadership/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"A glaring lack of legislative courage from federal and provincial politicians is staggering, and it will have real repercussions in the years to come",['Frank Addario'],2021-09-08 07:00:00,"Frank Addario is a lawyer in Toronto. An ambulance passes through a crowd of people protesting COVID-19 vaccine passports and mandatory vaccinations for health-care workers, in Vancouver.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press Canadians who are confused or angry about COVID-19′s surging fourth wave should blame their elected officials. For months, they have fumbled the crisis. In the midst of another year of uncertainty, the economy and public services require crisp and clear action, but no such thing is on the horizon - even though the tools are available to provincial and federal leaders to impose the health-protection directives we need. In Ontario, there is a decades-old law on the books called the Immunization of School Pupils Act. The law allows the government to list diseases against which all students must be immunized; if they fail to do so, they cannot attend school. Ontario has lost more school days than any other province since March, 2020 - but is Premier Doug Ford requiring students over 12 to be vaccinated against COVID-19? No. In the biggest crisis Mr. Ford will ever face as a leader, he has ignored science and refused to take steps to protect students, families and businesses. Last week, he grudgingly announced a diluted vaccine passport - all while protesting that it was not his first choice. In Alberta, meanwhile, the province routinely uses ministerial orders under the Public Health Act to direct how people with COVID-19 are treated. But its cabinet has not taken the obvious step needed to end the crisis: tying access to public facilities to proof of vaccination. Instead, Premier Jason Kenney is using taxpayer money to bribe the unvaccinated, announcing just last week that the government would pay $100 to anyone who now gets the jab. A small minority of anti-science noisemakers are now effectively dictating public policy to the Premier. Doug Ford just did a U-turn on vaccine passports. Better late than never Alberta government lack of foresight has them stumbling to stave off fourth wave of COVID-19 In Saskatchewan, Premier Scott Moe is presiding over the worst COVID-19 case numbers his province has endured since the pandemic was first declared. Last week, he pledged his support to organizations with vaccine mandates, but refused to impose his own, calling it ""heavy-handed."" Saskatchewan: you could be forgiven for thinking your premier was supposed to lead, not follow. When I hear leaders say they don't want to interfere with ""rights"" by imposing vaccine mandates, I am genuinely confused. Civil liberties fundamentalists - and I count myself as one - can distinguish between the state bursting into their homes and the state drawing lines to protect everyone else. Canada's Criminal Code, for example, is filled with ""do's and don'ts"" created by Parliament. It is designed to protect us from bad actors who don't care about our health and safety. Timorous politicians have argued that the imposition of vaccine mandates is authoritarian, but this is nonsense: The state has been regulating public health for decades, and vaccination is a long-established pillar of public health. Do the premiers really think we are dull enough to believe their torpor has to do with defending our civil liberties? What about Justin Trudeau? The federal Emergencies Act allows the government to declare a public-welfare emergency. One justification for this would be to note that the crisis is beyond the capacity of the provinces to act; like climate change, COVID-19 is not confined by arbitrary borders. That, combined with the weak leadership of some premiers, offers evidence that a national emergency is well under way. But Mr. Trudeau has yet to pull the trigger. Meanwhile, Erin O'Toole - his principal opponent in the election campaign - is promising to send mail-outs to the unvaccinated if elected. So much for bold vision. One way to think of the issue of vaccine mandates is through the framework of licensing. Citizens aren't allowed to drive a car without a licence, and those with medical problems (bad eyesight, say, or a history of seizures) need proof of a medical solution before getting behind the wheel. No one can smoke in a school, office or sporting arena. The justification for these rules is community safety. Why, then, should an unvaccinated person be allowed to cough hot COVID-19 droplets near you? Seen in this light, the arguments against vaccine mandates are illogical and inconsistent with Canadian law. The cowardice of elected officials has also put the burden of leadership on employers and service providers. This has led to a slew of dubious lawsuits by COVID-19 deniers. A Toronto police officer revealed the flavour of these arguments last week, describing her ""God-given inalienable right"" not to take a vaccine. The result of our legislative vacuum will be years of uncertainty, deeper suspicions about legitimate exemptions for medical and religious reasons. While the law cannot force vaccines on genuine objectors, government has an important role as a teacher. A government-led mandate would encourage life-saving vaccination, keep unvaccinated Canadians out of public settings, allow the economy to heal, and let the majority of Canadians return to normal life.

Mandryk: Mask opinions show how COVID-19 issues can evolve quickly,https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/mandryk-mask-opinions-show-how-covid-19-issues-can-evolve-quickly,leaderpost.com,We should be rightly appalled by masks being held at the Canadian border for reasons that may very will be about Trump's own narcissism.,['Murray Mandryk'],2020-04-06 00:00:00,"Photo by Yuri Gripas/Abaca/Bloomberg What's perhaps most stunning about Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe calling U.S. President Donald Trump's behaviour ""reckless"" and a ""betrayal"" for barring the export of needed N95 masks to Canada is that he's not exactly been inclined to criticize those with whom he holds an even remote philosophical alliance. To their credit, Canadian premiers and the prime minister have stood fast with their Team Canada approach that has evolved because partisanship is being removed from the decision making process. Ensconced in briefings with doctors, scientists and sharing more information among themselves than perhaps any time in our history, it would be shocking if we didn't see collective wisdom emerge among Canadian leaders … which makes Trump's stupidity all that much more puzzling given that he would be subject to the same information and process. That said, given our own well-established Canadian smugness, we need to guard against falling into the same trap. This takes us back to the issues of masks - in this case, Trump's advocacy of people generally using face-covering to stop public transmission of droplets that is quickly gaining traction among decidedly non-Donald Trump thinkers. Sunday, Saskatchewan Opposition Leader Ryan Meili - a medial doctor - was not only advocating widespread use of masks by everyone but also providing a tutorial on how to fashion masks out of an everyday item. Asked Sunday about supporting something that Trump has been advocating, Meili replied: ""Even a broken clock is right twice a day."" But, significantly, Meili noted both the science and learning curve on COVID-19 transmissions and how to stop it is emerging rapidly. This is evident in that it took until Monday for Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam to come around to supporting the notion of widespread public mask use. Also, the World Health Organization has only recently changed its view on widespread use of face masks. To flatten the curve requires leaders to stay ahead of it and, frankly, one of the wisest moves Moe could make is to task someone - perhaps Meili, but others might be capable - with the education about and distribution of non-medical masks. Another such advocate is epidemiologist Dr. Mark Lemstra who noted in an interview Sunday that medi-analysis shows the best way to stifle the spread of a SARS-like respiratory virus is mass mask use. And Lemstra points to everything from the success in South Korea, Japan, Indonesia Hong Kong and China (where spread has been limited) to the fact that San Fransisco and Los Angeles limited the 1918 spread of the Spanish Flu by widespread mask use. We need to look at the best scientific practices that are rapidly evolving. Where they come from matters little.

"Chris Selley: Now that the COVID-zero fallacy is toast, Canada needs a real exit strategy",https://nationalpost.com/opinion/chris-selley-now-that-the-covid-zero-fallacy-is-toast-canada-needs-a-real-exit-strategy,nationalpost.com,"Just a few weeks ago, Justin Trudeau said Canada is not a country that forces people to get vaccinated to participate in everyday life. He was right",['Chris Selley'],2021-08-27 00:00:00,"Photo by Loren Elliott/Reuters/File Australia's COVID-zero bubble has burst. ""(Lockdowns) cannot go on forever. This is not a sustainable way to live in this country,"" Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said at a news conference on Monday in Canberra. ""It will end when we start getting to 70 per cent and 80 per cent (vaccination)."" In theory, this is an uncontroversial and inevitable position: Having kept COVID-19 more or less at bay, and accepting that this virus and its mutations will be with us for the long haul, Australia will eventually have to reopen and hope the vaccines keep working their magic. In practice, however, it calls the country's entire strategy into question. For starters, only a quarter of Australians are fully vaccinated. At the current rate, it would take 17 weeks to get to 80 per cent. That's assuming there's enough supply, which there is not , and assuming 80 per cent of Australians are willing to get vaccinated, which is considerably more than the 64 per cent a survey of 2,400 Australians conducted in April and May found. In the meantime, it's all going pear-shaped. In New South Wales, case counts are five times higher than they have ever been, at 10 per day per 100,000 population. That's hardly catastrophic: British Columbia is currently at 12, Alberta at 18. But the situation could get a lot worse: case counts more than doubled in just nine days ending Thursday, and with a proper lockdown in place: Sydneysiders aren't allowed more than five kilometres from home; only one member of a household is allowed out at a time to shop for essentials. Melbourne, too, is back in lockdown - its sixth. There's a 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. (In Sydney the curfew is currently confined to the poorer, immigrant-rich western suburbs.) Months after we learned surface transmission really isn't much of a concern, playgrounds are off-limits. More On This Topic Alberta to make COVID vaccine confirmation cards available COVID restrictions reinstated in B.C., Quebec and Manitoba as cases surge For months, many Canadian public health experts insisted Australia's COVID-zero approach should be Canada's as well. Never mind the practical impediments. (Australia's economy does not rely on 110,000 truck drivers crossing the border every week.) And never mind that many of the things Australia did are literally inconceivable here. In July last year, Victoria Police locked 3,000 residents of nine Melbourne public housing towers in their homes for 14 days, 24 hours a day, with no notice. Australian police officers routinely arrest scores of anti-lockdown protesters at a time; Canadian police officers escort anti-lockdown marches around town on their bicycles. Australia can certainly claim remarkable success on the very important metric of keeping people alive: At 38 deaths per million population, it has fared better than all developed nations except Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and New Zealand. But Australia's draconian lockdowns will likely impose a far greater social toll than Canada's. That's precisely what COVID-zero's proponents claimed the approach would prevent. ""At the end of the COVID-zero path lies safety and longstanding freedom, whereas, on the other path, freedom will be fleeting, and will certainly result in an ongoing roller-coaster of restrictions,"" three Calgary doctors wrote in a Herald op-ed in February. The Aussies have been stuck on that rollercoaster for months. And now they're trailing most of the world on vaccinations. And a lot of people are angry: An Essential Research poll published August 17 found just 37 per cent of folks in Victoria and 34 per cent in New South Wales approving of their state governments' pandemic performance, down from 65 per cent and 69 per cent in March. All that said, Australia at least had a plan and stuck to it. It's more than many Canadian governments, certainly the one that recently vacated Ottawa to hold a pointless election, can claim. The federal Liberals' appalling record has been to dismiss things other countries are doing as unnecessary, misguided and possibly racist, until late on a Sunday night, and then adopt them as matters of urgent priority on the Monday morning. The provinces have hardly been better, particularly Ontario. The latest whispers out of Queen's Park suggest Ontario will soon follow Manitoba, British Columbia and Quebec in adopting a vaccine passport system. If it does, the government will have no good answer to offer as to what took so long. Photo by Darrian Traynor/Getty Images Vaccine passports are the solution du jour. They are certainly defensible, but they're not a slam dunk (although they are a blunt incentive for people to get vaccinated). A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study published this week suggests the Delta variant reduces the effectiveness of vaccines (specifically Pfizer and Moderna) against infection from 91 per cent to 66 per cent, and a preprint study from researchers at the University of Wisconsin, also published this week, suggests vaccinated and asymptomatic people can have just as much live Delta-variant virus in their nostrils, just waiting to be transmitted , as unvaccinated people. That's the bad news. The good news: A Public Health England study published in June found Pfizer was 96 per cent effective in preventing hospitalization even from the Delta variant, and AstraZeneca 92 per cent. There's a complex discussion about risk and freedom to be had from those findings, all of which could be overturned by future study or future variants: To what extent is an unvaccinated restaurant patron only risking his own health? How much risk to the vaccinated are we willing to tolerate in the name of not effectively forcing medical procedures on unwilling people? Don't take my word for it. Take Justin Trudeau's. In May, online broadcaster Brandon Gonez asked the prime minister if it was conceivable that people who can't or choose not to get vaccinated would be barred from a Toronto Raptors game. ""I'm really worried about that,"" Trudeau replied. He said he understood the potential value of such policies ""as a motivator"" to get needles in arms, but asked: ""What do you do with someone … who for religious or deep convictions decides that, no, they're not going to get a vaccine?"" ""We're not a country that makes vaccination mandatory,"" Trudeau confidently concluded. He was right. Most environments in this country where vaccination is theoretically mandatory - in public schools, for example - offer no-questions-asked exemptions. It's nauseating to see Trudeau, in campaign mode, now stumping for mandatory vaccination for airline and interprovincial train passengers, dismissing the idea of religious or conscientious objections, and claiming it's all ""about protecting our young people,"" all for political gain. Whatever we think of vaccine passports, we should be intensely leery of politicians proposing to limit people's freedoms because it's popular. We should demand coherent explanations, based on the best data available, and we should demand the sort of exit strategy that Australians, unfortunately, now lack. • Email: cselley@nationalpost.com | Twitter: cselley NP Posted Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the National Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

The contributions of those working minimum-wage or low-income jobs - whether they were grocery store cashiers, delivery drivers, warehouse workers fulfilling online shopping orders, aides in long-term care facilities, among others - were now considered essential. It became immediately clear that their work needed to continue in order to make sure food and other goods were readily available to the public. The only problem? Their essential work did not provide them with a living wage that allowed them to sufficiently provide for themselves, their families, and reach basic financial security. In order to address this disparity and to make sure these workers still showed up in the face of tremendous risk, workers at major grocery chains such as Loblaws, Save-on-Foods, and Safeway were given a temporary pay raise - usually $2 per hour - in acknowledgment of their hard work. This increase - often called ""hero pay"" - was a boon for these workers. Many reported feeling greater financial security, being able to afford their bills without having to choose which ones to pay, and worker morale improved with a sense they were more appreciated by their employer. However, by the summer time, the grocery chains phased out their bonus pay as the economy started to re-open and active cases of COVID-19 were declining. Now that Canada and much of the world is experiencing a brutal second wave of infections that has surpassed the worst of the first wave, it is time for hero pay to be brought back to the table. The Edmonton Social Planning Council's latest edition of Tracking the Trends keeps track of short-term and long-term trends in Edmonton's social well-being. The evidence is clear that normalizing a living wage for essential services is long overdue, especially during a public health emergency like this. An average of 117,300 employed persons were earning less than the living wage in the Edmonton area, which we have calculated to be $16.51 per hour as of 2019. Almost two-thirds of these workers are women. The cost of living in Edmonton continues to increase steadily over time with inflation increasing by 17.8 per cent and food costs rising at double the rate of inflation over the last 20 years. With the pandemic requiring everyone to isolate, many are turning to food delivery services to remain safe and as a result, they are burdened with additional fees for delivery. These trends suggest these living costs will not be improving anytime soon. Keeping wages stagnant does not serve those who are literally risking their lives to make sure food is stocked on store shelves. The added stress of dealing with the uncertainty of customers complying with public health measures - such as wearing a mask - makes their work environment that much more stressful. To their credit, the grocery chain Sobeys has wisely decided to reinstate this bonus pay to their workers in parts of Manitoba and Ontario where lockdown measures are in place. This indicates they understand the pressures these workers are under. We would strongly encourage other grocery stores - big and small - to show that they value their workers' contributions by bringing back their own hero pay nationwide, including Edmonton where new emergency measures are in place. Once the pandemic subsides and a vaccine is readily available, this bonus pay should be made a permanent part of their workplace policies as everybody should be able to make a livable income. After all, do we want these workers to continue to make difficult decisions on whether to pay their heating bill or forgo other expenses? If we are sincere in lauding their work as heroic, these pay raises are the bare minimum we can extend to them. Sydney Sheloff is Research Officer for the Edmonton Social Planning Council.

"Postelection, what should the new government’s pandemic priorities be?",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-post-election-what-should-the-new-governments-pandemic-priorities-be/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"With the fourth wave of COVID-19 raging, and a starting-to-feel-inevitable fifth wave on the horizon for early 2022, where does new federal leadership begin?",['André Picard'],2021-09-20 19:46:33,"The pandemic election may be over, but the pandemic itself isn't. Far from it. When he kicked off the campaign to determine the shape of the 44th Parliament, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau called it the most important vote since the 1945 election after the Second World War. Yet, in the past 36 days, there was more talk about the need (or lack thereof) for an election than there was about how the next government would actually manage the continuing challenges of COVID-19 - economic, social and political. So, with the fourth wave of COVID-19 raging, and a starting-to-feel-inevitable fifth wave on the horizon for early 2022, where does new federal leadership begin? The most logical starting point is following through on the initiatives that were put on hold before the vote was called. Will there be vaccine mandates for federal workers, as promised? This is an important issue, symbolically if nothing else. It will also set a standard for workplaces across the country. The Liberals vowed to make vaccination mandatory for all federal employees and Crown corporations (without yet stating the consequence for non-compliance), and said they expect the same in federally regulated industries such as banking. The New Democrats went further, saying get the jab or be fired. The Conservatives have said regular testing should be offered as an alternative to vaccination. These are important distinctions that other employers will be watching with interest. This crummy, miserable, not very good election Indigenous issues are, in fact, pivotal in this election There is also the issue of what role testing will play going forward. Canada has never embraced rapid testing the way many other countries have, and investments in this area will become more important, especially with provinces allowing exemptions from mandates and proof-of-vaccination programs. Speaking of which, there needs to be some serious federal effort to create a national vaccine passport, and quickly. We don't need another level of bureaucracy, but Canada does need to create an easy-to-use vaccine passport for international travellers, as well as bring some standardization to the various provincial programs, especially now that some of the recalcitrant provinces are on board. It makes no sense, for example, that Alberta and B.C. have dramatically different proof-of-vaccination standards. But the role of the federal government is not to create national rules, just facilitate technical interoperability so proof-of-vaccination apps can be used across jurisdictions. Let's not forget that the feds gave the provinces $1-billion to develop these technologies. A little co-operation is not too much to expect in return, regardless of the party in power. While pandemic-related campaign debate rarely moved beyond the question of whether those running for office were vaccinated, there are some much bigger vaccine questions to resolve. Canada has administered more than 55 million vaccine doses to date, with 79.5 per cent of the eligible population (those over 12) fully vaccinated. That's not good enough, especially with unvaccinated people filling up hospital beds and intensive care units. We need all hands on deck to promote vaccine uptake, and the Public Health Agency of Canada was shamefully quiet during the election campaign, holding only one briefing in more than a month. Communication is central to public health, and silence is not acceptable. The disturbing politicization of vaccination, which was accelerated by anti-vax protesters targeting hospitals, certainly hasn't helped the cause. The new government needs a more aggressive response to these yahoos. Free speech does not extend to harming patients and health care providers. Then there is the question of boosters. Some groups, such as frail elders living in institutional settings and patients with conditions that leave them immunocompromised, would benefit from a third shot. The jury is still out on whether boosters would benefit people more generally. What is not in doubt is much more effort is needed to vaccinate those in the developing world. Canada, which has 400 million vaccines on order, can afford to be more generous. There's plenty to do now so we won't even get into the longer-term challenges posed by COVID-19: the need for domestic vaccine production, critical shortages of nurses and other health workers, the massive backlog of surgeries, rebuilding the pandemic warning system and more. In short, the new government needs to hit the ground running and make tackling COVID-19 a priority, not just a secondary and partisan talking point. None of the would-be prime ministers showed any leadership on the pandemic question during the campaign. Postelection, they will have a chance to redeem themselves - and they must.

Canada's entire COVID lockdown policy, combined with our negligent failure to obtain adequate supplies of vaccine, has been a disaster, yet the Trudeau government is still preening itself about it, and the opposition isn't scoring. It was obvious on the available facts almost a year ago that the COVID-19 survival rate was 99 per cent for healthy people up to 65, and approximately 95 per cent for the elderly and infirm and that the only successful approach was to pull out all stops to develop a vaccine while segregating the elderly and otherwise vulnerable and permitting the remaining 80 per cent of society to get on with their lives. As usual, Canada fell in with the U.S. fad, but we completely failed to provide for vaccine, with the result that we are now the most backward advanced country in the northern hemisphere in actually resolving the problem: Seven per cent of our population has been fully vaccinated, compared to 11 per cent in Mexico, 22 per cent in Poland which has less than a third of our standard of living, 42 per cent in the United States, the country that we were otherwise imitating, and 59 per cent in Israel. The last two countries have effectively reached herd immunity, are wide open, and fatalities are plummeting. When Drs. Banting and McLeod won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of insulin in 1923 Canada was an advanced pharmacological country and Connaught Laboratories was a supplier to the world of many medicines. Sustained public policy errors have left us with almost no pharmacological industry and when events like the COVID pandemic occur, we are sitting ducks, susceptible to officially ordered transmogrification into cowardly, (impecunious) moles, cogs in the Davos-Trudeau ambition to turn us into socialistic eco-geeks of the Great Reset. It is now obvious that the coronavirus generated two genius acts of improvisation: in China - where the virus likely originated, and possibly from a lab leak - the state suppressed its spread with totalitarian methods, and exported it to the world, dealing the West a crushing economic blow, millions of deaths, and generating the Trump-hate coalition's other marvelous improvisation - the Democratic media, which made the campaign for the wax-works nominee, terrorized the country to drive Trump from office, and he happened to be the only world leader seriously facing up to the China challenge. He was defamed for bungling the pandemic, but he was chiefly responsible for the rapid development of the vaccine. Most of Europe wallowed in the exaggerated woes of the Coronavirus, but none more proudly and ""systemically"" than Canada. My wife recently returned from two weeks in the U.S. and was handed a form that advised her that ""Since you recently entered Canada with no symptoms of COVID-19, you must quarantine for a minimum of 14 days,"" failing which, ""could lead to a ticket of up to $5000, six months in prison, and/or fines of up to $750,000."" Any violation of quarantine that could be imputed to have contributed to the death of someone else and ""you could face a fine of up to $1,000,000 or imprisonment of up to three years or both."" Have we gone mad? This is authoritarian nonsense in support of an insane policy. In ""following the science"" over COVID, we were led astray, just as we have been in the hysteria about climate change. This is a very murky area that requires research rather than instant radical and economically destructive action. If the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff really told President Biden that the greatest threat facing the United States was climate change, as he said in Britain on Wednesday, they should be court-martialed. The latest flare-up of this misplaced, imitative, Canadian public policy lunacy has been around race. We don't have mass pseudo-racist riots as the U.S. does, but 10,000 people have signed a petition demanding the removal of a statue of Egerton Ryerson and the change of name of Ryerson University because of his connection to the native residential schools. Ryerson was a distinguished pioneer of public education in Ontario and like his co-authors of the native residential schools project, he sought to educate native children. Ryerson's intentions were commendable and the University should dismiss these complaints. The discovery of hundreds of graves at a residential school site in British Columbia has naturally inspired another round of Canadian self flagellation. Everyone dies and in this culture most dead people are buried, and in the 19th century inordinate numbers of young people died of tuberculosis and other illnesses; any conclusion about these recently discovered graves should await a serious forensic examination. As I've often written before, the native people have substantial grievances and Canada's policy towards them has generally failed, and we have to do better. The residential schools question is much more ambiguous than has been represented in the summary of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The leaders of the native victimhood industry have misled and dishonoured this country; Few Canadians are aware that we are officially pursuing the proposals of the Dussault-Erasmus Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples report of 1996 that proposed greatly expanding land in Canada that will be permanently designated to native people where they may flourish autonomously and tax-free. I've had some email and twitter exchanges this week with exponents of the self-awarded guilt of their ""white privilege."" All members of all reputable groups should be proud of what they are; in this respect as in some others, the gay community has shown us the way forward. While some white people, like some people of all other races, have abused their positions, that justifies no collective guilt. The concept of white guilt is abusive. To cite the refreshingly original Canadian writer Irving Layton, ""Philistinism is not Olympian serenity and the spitefulness of the weak is not moral indignation."" Canada should try to lead the world in addressing these issues constructively, and not in misplaced and simpleminded self-degradation. That should be our answer to those trying to rename Ryerson University, evict John A. Macdonald from our national consciousness, and abolish Canada Day as a result of conjurations of misplaced shame. It is time to make a bonfire of political correctness and return to ""systemic"" common sense.

Opinion: The failure of Canada's pandemic early warning system - and how to fix it,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-the-failure-of-canadas-pandemic-early-warning-system-and-how-to-fix-it,nationalpost.com,"In responding to COVID-19, the system failed — or, more charitably, had little chance of success from the outset","['Adrian Levy', 'Wesley Wark', 'Special To National Post']",2021-07-28 00:00:00,"Opinion: The failure of Canada's pandemic early warning system - and how to fix it Opinion: The failure of Canada's pandemic early warning system - and how to fix it The recently released final report of the independent panel reviewing the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) - Canada's pandemic early warning system - is a harbinger of the challenges to come once we turn our full attention to preventing future outbreaks of disease and other biosecurity threats. GPHIN (pronounced gee-fin) was a toothless cog in the machinery of the federal government's response to biological risks. In responding to COVID-19, it failed - or, more charitably, had little chance of success from the outset. GPHIN was prevented from issuing warning reports to a global audience and its internal reporting lacked any clout. Opinion: The failure of Canada's pandemic early warning system - and how to fix it The circumstances that neutralized a system once considered a leading example of Canadian innovation in global health security point to the scale of reform that's needed if Canada is to be better prepared to meet the next biological threat. Such reforms will need to include better leadership, better organization, better integration of efforts across government, more resources and enhanced use of technology. Reform also means a genuine desire to achieve excellence and to position Canada as an effective global leader in health security. It means embracing the reality that health security cannot be effectively achieved within national boundaries and that we must have the ability to gather information from around the globe and be prepared to rapidly respond to emerging biological threats. The reality, which has been long known and was directly experienced by Canada during the 2003 SARS epidemic, is that health threats emerge outside our borders, magnify rapidly and easily cross geographic boundaries. GPHIN was meant to be our ace in the hole. It was a true innovation when it was established in the late 1990s, as it was one of the very first platforms created to utilize the internet as a source of global information about emerging health threats by curating digital media reporting. Its premise was that warning signals would likely first emerge unofficially and that we could get a head start on identifying biological risks and responding appropriately. It proved its worth over and over again - that is, until COVID-19 struck. While GPHIN was able to identify a new and unknown pneumonia-like disease in China as early as Dec. 30, 2019, it was unable to play a larger role in the Canadian or international response. Its ability to disseminate alerts, or early warning messages, to a global audience had been stymied by some mysterious organization-level fiat. The information that it produced through an intensive process of technological collection (capturing some 7,000 global news items per day) and human editing, conducted by a ludicrously small team of 10 analysts, made virtually no impact on higher-level decision-making. It had, in government-speak, been ""siloed"" into invisibility and irrelevance. This reflected a cultural problem at the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), an inward turn that abandoned a once-strong global commitment. In the years before COVID, GPHIN followed this drumbeat by turning its attention to disease outbreaks closer to home, including the opioid crisis in Canada and the United States. The Independent GPHIN review panel, led by Margaret Bloodworth, a former national security adviser to the prime minister, has good ideas about how to fix these issues. The panel's final report characterizes GPHIN as an essential element of global health surveillance and argues that it must be maintained by the federal government - to outsource it would be wrong. GPHIN's ability to send alerts must be one of its core functions in the future. GPHIN needs to become more nimble, with the ability to quickly adapt to technological change. It must find a way to exploit social media in its search for early warning signals. It must get better at tailoring its products for an audience of decision-making consumers. It must actively train the next generation of experts, starting with students. And in the face of emerging zoonotic diseases and antimicrobial drug resistance, it must expand its repertoire to include domestic syndromic surveillance, as well. Over and above these recommendations, three things stand out in the final report. One is that GPHIN is useless unless its reports are properly integrated into an adequate risk-assessment process to inform decision-makers in a timely fashion. This underscores the auditor general's urgent call to reform the broken and dysfunctional risk-assessment system at PHAC. The auditor general's performance report on PHAC's pandemic preparedness painted a devastating portrait of a risk-assessment system that was unfinished, untested and not fit for purpose, despite years of work. In response, PHAC promised an internal review to improve the system, but urgency on this file seems missing. A second point, not fully elaborated in the panel's report, is that health intelligence needs to be better integrated into the government's national security process, including through better connectivity with the security and intelligence community. A third finding is that GPHIN needs to be reconnected to the global ecosystem of health surveillance and early warning systems. The World Health Organization and several of our strongest allies - including the U.S., United Kingdom and Germany - have all taken important steps in this regard. Canada needs to reassert its global role. The independent panel makes clear that Canada cannot afford to waste this opportunity to improve our early warning systems, if we hope to be prepared for the next major health threat. It is high time to commit to a sweeping, independent review of all aspects of our response to COVID-19, while attention levels are high and before complacency sets in.

Derek Burney: Meandering facts and directives on COVID are sapping public trust,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/derek-burney-meandering-facts-and-directives-on-covid-are-sapping-public-trust,nationalpost.com,"COVID is stimulating more fear than common sense and is aggravated by fatigue, uncertainty and a craving for a return to normalcy",['Derek H. Burney'],2021-10-20 00:00:00,"Photo by David Bloom Canada and the U.S are both struggling to cope with the seemingly endless COVID challenge. Given erratic messaging in both countries, it is no wonder that their publics are confused, skeptical and frustrated. . Vaccines were seen initially as a miracle cure with efficacy rates over 90 per cent. With the highly contagious delta variant, there is less certainty around efficacy, which raises concerns for future variants. U.S. President Joe Biden expressed impatience over the reluctance of 80 million Americans to get vaccinated and, in what some suspect was intended partly to deflect attention from the Afghan debacle, he announced draconian vaccine mandates for most federal employees and for all private companies with more than 100 employees. These mandates applied to those who have had the disease and whose immune system is reportedly stronger than those who have been vaccinated. Mandates are easier to announce than to implement. Biden's actions triggered protests about ""overreach"" from 19 Republican Governors, sparked lawsuits and outright rejections by some nurses, teachers and police contributing to serious staff shortages in places like New York City. Objections to vaccine mandates are also being raised in Canada, though less vigorously. People are losing trust in the meandering and at times politicized facts and directives being announced and wondering whether the strategy on COVID is working. While generally accepting the value of vaccinations many question the need and constitutionality of coercion through mandates. Some see this as excessive control by governments. President Biden announced that Americans should get a ""booster"" shot eight months after being doubly vaccinated for COVID, but no rationale was provided for the eight month wait. Nor is there enough evidence that the proposed booster is necessary. The Food and Drug Administration's Advisory Committee delivered a stinging rebuke to the president voting 16-2 against giving the booster to the general public but the CDC Director rejected their advice and insisted on broader implementation. Mask mandates are back though opinions remain mixed on their utility, especially for those already vaccinated. Concerns have also been raised about the deleterious effects mask wearing for six to eight hours per day have on young children in school. What we do know is that virtual teaching outside the classrooms did not work well. Nor did remote working prove to be productive for governments or many in the private sector. Statistics on COVID mortality rates can be misleading because, especially among seniors, pre-existing conditions can contribute to death. One salient fact is that the impact on long term care residents has been severe in both Canada and the U.S., suggesting that these facilities should have been given much higher priority from the outset. There are also questions about whether the lockdowns that paralyzed much of the North American economy and the functioning of governments, notably the educational systems, were necessary. Drastic efforts to contain the disease come at a price. A clash between the common good and individual freedoms is never easy to resolve. In Canada, John Carpay, President of the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedom, has challenged in court many COVID edicts that he believes violate fundamental human rights. In a June op/ed he wrote , ""We have the ideology of Covidism, whereby everything must give way to the sole objective of stopping the spread of a single virus … Nothing else matters: not our mental and emotional health which depends on connecting in person with friends, family members and fellow believers at a house of worship."" According to Carpay, ""Covidism's kernel of truth is that people make reasonable efforts to protect seniors and other vulnerable individuals but it perverts and corrupts this truth by imposing unscientific measures that destroy our economy, shred the fabric of civil society, harm our mental and physical health and drive people into unemployment, poverty, depression, anxiety and despair."" His concerns should prompt a broader perspective on the virus, something sadly absent from much of the debate. Our singular obsession with COVID has completely overshadowed dramatic spikes in the use of opioids like fentanyl in 2020 and the first six months of 2021. A June report from the Public Health Agency of Canada found that, on average, 17 people died per day of opioid overdoses in 2020. Drug overdoses increased 87 per cent in Manitoba last year. B.C. reported that the first half of 2021 had the most ever drug deaths in the first six months of any year. The total - 1,011 - was 30 per cent higher than the previous year and, for those aged 19-39, drug toxicity was the leading cause of death. In New Brunswick, there were four times more overdose deaths in 2020 than those related to COVID. The supports people usually have for addiction care have largely been redirected toward people with COVID. Whenever the virus does recede, the government should try to rebuild trust in public health directives by launching an independent Blue Ribbon panel to review Canada's performance on the virus and provide explicit guidance on how to respond better on future outbreaks of disease. More broadly, as Sean Speer observed in the Hub, ""it is time to replace anger and frustration with aspiration and purpose."" National Post Derek H. Burney was chief of staff to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney from 1987-1989 and ambassador to the United States of America from 1989-1993.

Adults are hanging out again and returning to the workplace; children's activities have resumed and in several provinces COVID-19 restrictions and mask rules are gone. This just makes sense. For Canada, the pandemic has greatly receded and thanks to various developments, including extremely high vaccination rates, the virus is now shifting into an endemic illness that is of much less concern than it was before. We will still face challenges moving forward, but - as so many experts and officials around the world have said - we are now in the learning to live with COVID-19 phase. However, there's a small but vocal group who refuse to embrace the good news and feel that the show must go on. It's a group which is comprised of a curious alliance of people. You've got those little authoritarians who've come into their true selves this past year-and-a-half, delighting in badgering people about what they can do and where they must stand. Then you've got the faux elite intellectuals, who form their opinions not by thinking for themselves but just by doing the exact opposite of whatever people they ideologically oppose say, thereby boxing themselves into a long-term commitment to lockdowns and masks regardless of the facts. There are the low-information contingent who are only seeing the doom and gloom headlines and tweets and aren't aware of the considerable nuanced and contextualized information that has led others towards embracing a better path forward. (This group are kind of like the cult members who are more victims of manipulation than they are truly complicit in the scam.) Perhaps the most disturbing contingent of this motley crew are the previously anonymous medical voices who know their time in the limelight is coming to an end but now can't bear to lose their influence over people. All of the above combine to make up Canada's COVID busybodies - those people who still obsess over the ebb and flow of daily case counts, refuse to give up the surreal COVID Zero agenda, and scour the globe in search of inklings of bad news to amplify. Tristin Hopper, writing in the National Post, wrote a recent feature breaking down in detail some of the COVID-19 myths that continue to do the rounds: COVID-19 is dangerous to children; masking and self-isolation is necessary after full vaccination; the variants are deadlier and resistant to vaccines. None of these are true, but COVID busybodies can't let them go. It's like these are the dogmas of their new religion. There's sadly been a lot of fraying of the social fabric this past year and a half, with opinions among family and friends starkly split and people calling the cops on their neighbours. You'd at least think we can put most of that behind us now. That's not always happening though - in some sense things are getting worse. Take the debate over domestic vaccine passports, where you need to show paperwork to get into stores and restaurants: We're in better shape than we've been since this began and yet we're having one of our most divisive and hostile debates to date. Canada has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, but domestic passport advocates have suddenly adopted an urgent, manic energy. For a lot of COVID busybodies, they are so far down a culture war rabbit hole that they now just get a kick out of the idea of punishing and excluding people who aren't behaving exactly like them. Kudos to the likes of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Ontario Premier Doug Ford who have recognized this divisiveness and see domestic passports as a step too far. So where do we go from here? There doesn't seem to be any reasoning with COVID busybodies. And they certainly won't leave the rest of us alone. Maybe our best hope moving forward is to chuckle at their strange little community and stop giving them the attention and air time that they crave.

"Opinion: Why vaccine passports won't slow COVID spread, will hurt the poor and threaten medical ethics",https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-why-vaccine-passports-wont-slow-covid-spread-will-hurt-the-poor-and-threaten-medical-ethics,nationalpost.com,Six good reasons to rethink vaccine certificates,"['Alanna Golden', 'Gil Nimni', 'Sandra Rao', 'Neil Rau', 'Special To National Post']",2021-09-09 00:00:00,"Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post By Alanna Golden, Gil Nimni, Sandra Rao and Neil Rau The COVID-19 pandemic has represented a serious global health crisis resulting in devastating levels of serious illness and more than 27,000 deaths in Canada alone. Fortunately, the rapid development of highly effective vaccines has significantly reduced the danger posed by the virus, even with the emergence of the Delta variant. Vaccine certificates have been rolled out across the country with participation from Quebec, British Columbia, and now Ontario. The federal government has earmarked $1 billion for their implementation. Individuals will be required to demonstrate proof of vaccination status in order to access ""non-essential"" services. While it is an important societal goal to maximize vaccination coverage in adults, it is also important to consider whether the end justifies the means. 1. What is the intent and what are the end points? Vaccine certificates impose a significant burden on the population. There will be ongoing costs to taxpayers to maintain this system, and businesses will bear costs for implementation and oversight, and may be subjected to fines. The additional uptake in vaccination rates in those who are either unvaccinated or without natural immunity from previous infection is unclear. Moreover, it is unclear whether vaccine certificates will impact those at greatest risk of severe disease either directly with increased rates of vaccination or indirectly with reduced rates of hospitalization and death, especially in hard-to-reach groups. In a rush to implement this system, governments have been unclear about how they will measure efficacy, which implies there may not be a clear plan on when to scale back; perceivably, this program could be in effect for years to come. With the precedent for vaccine certificates established, there may be a desire to include other seasonal viruses, excluding increasingly larger segments of society from ""non-essential"" services. 2. Can we stop transmission with vaccine certificates? Probably not. The latest data suggest that vaccination reduces transmission by around 50 per cent at six months with evidence of further waning thereafter. Vaccines may help to slow spread of the virus, but they will not achieve the kind of herd immunity we see with such diseases as measles. Vaccine certificates may offer a false sense of reassurance to those who are vaccinated, if the belief is that they cannot contract or transmit the virus. The data is clear that vaccines offer a substantial reduction in risk of serious illness and death. If the goal of the certificate program is to provide further protection to those already vaccinated, this both underestimates the substantial protection already afforded and overestimates the efficacy of the vaccine in reducing transmission. Vaccine certificates for ""non-essential"" services will not touch industries hit hardest in previous waves, such as warehouses and factories. Implementation of targeted approaches in at-risk workplaces makes more sense, with the deployment of mobile vaccination units, regular point of care testing and protected pay for those with symptoms or high-risk exposures. More On This Topic Chris Selley: With fake war over vaccination policies, Liberals making a drama out of a farce Ginny Roth: By raging against the hesitant, Liberals are undermining our vaccination campaign 3. What are the logistical considerations of such a program? Those who are fully vaccinated may be amongst those denied access if they do not have a printer or mobile device, or if they have forgotten their documentation at home. This will especially impact the poor, those who are homeless, those with developmental delays or those who suffer from cognitive impairment. Newcomers will be subject to another set of vaccines if those approved in their home country are not recognized here. Businesses will be asked to deny services, sometimes to long-standing, loyal customers, at the expense of lost income desperately needed after months of forced closures. In addition, we can expect the workloads of numerous providers (ie. doctors, religious leaders) to grow exponentially with the additional tasks of proving vaccination status or providing exemptions. This demand will almost certainly strain relationships at a time when rapport could facilitate positive decision-making around vaccination. 4. What are the unintended consequences? Let's take the example of fitness gyms, which have been deemed ""non-essential."" One of the most important risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness is obesity. Many people rely on gyms, especially during the winter months, to access physical activity and maintain their ideal body weight. Those who live in apartment dwellings may not have access to green spaces for exercise. Thus, by barring access to gyms, we are restricting physical activity, which in turn contributes to increasing rates of obesity and greater risk for severe disease. Ironically, by excluding the unvaccinated from common social institutions, we run the risk of congregation of unvaccinated individuals outside of these institutions. When this does occur, it is more likely to be without mitigation measures. COVID-19 is spread through social networks, meaning that this action could increase the number of infections circulating amongst unvaccinated people, increasing adverse outcomes. 5. Why are people vaccine-hesitant? While it is easy to dismiss the unvaccinated as conspiracy theorists and selfish, this is overly simplistic and frankly inaccurate. The unvaccinated are disproportionately of lower socio-economic status, ethnic minorities and children. Many minority groups have legitimate reasons to distrust the medical establishment, based on a long and sordid history of racism and classism. Some are unable to get vaccinated because they cannot afford time off work for vaccination and post-vaccine side effects. It is imperative that we understand the unintended potential health equity impacts of vaccine certificates on specific population groups, and that we target our efforts to vaccinate these populations in a way that is respectful, accessible and meaningful. Perhaps the greatest oversight with vaccine certificates is the lack of recognition of natural immunity. Those who have been previously infected may not wish to receive vaccination. This conviction is supported by recent data that natural immunity is as good or better than vaccine-induced immunity. If this is true, why are we excluding those with durable protection from society? Moreover, a lack of acknowledgement of protection by way of natural immunity may serve to reinforce the optics of pharmaceutical involvement in policy-making. 6. Are vaccine certificates ethical? One of the most sacred principles in medical ethics is autonomy, meaning that an individual has the right to decide what happens to their body. Those with underlying health conditions may genuinely fear vaccines could worsen their overall health; a belief which requires empathy and education. Even the most well-informed individual cannot provide informed consent if their ""choice"" is coerced. Vaccine certificates render the individual in an impossible place of having to choose vaccination or loss of employment and exclusion from society. This impossible ""choice"" forces the hand of those in this predicament and ultimately results in consent under duress. While population-based data are reassuring in terms of overall vaccine safety, side effects do occur. How will we respond when vaccine-hesitant individuals experience a serious adverse event, claiming that they did not ""choose"" to have vaccination in the first place? Loss of trust in the medical establishment can lead to poor health outcomes, as patients may avoid care and be less receptive to medical management. Given that we have exceeded numerous vaccine targets and offered protection to those at greatest risk, we should make every effort at this time to maintain patient autonomy and guide with openness rather than exclusion. Public health interventions need to take into account not only the immediate threat before us, but also the downstream negative effects that may occur as a result of our actions. The introduction of vaccine certificates threatens individual autonomy and societal norms, and runs the risk of further isolating marginalized groups without clear metrics to assess efficacy. The sacrifices that have been made throughout this pandemic are astonishing and we have achieved great success with excellent vaccine uptake overall. After a long and lonely battle, we need to remember, ""we're all in this together""; now, more than ever, we need to unite as a society.

Bruce Pardy: COVID has cost Canadians their freedom. It must be restored,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/bruce-pardy-covid-has-cost-canadians-their-freedom-it-must-be-restored,nationalpost.com,Lawyers launch the Free North Declaration — a call to defend civil liberties in this country,"['Bruce Pardy', 'Special To National Post']",2021-11-20 00:00:00,"Many years ago, as a new law student, I had a moment of disbelief. ""Surely it doesn't really work this way,"" I thought to myself as I sat in an early class. The law, I discovered, is not a set of immutable rules, predictable and secure. Instead, it is rife with ambiguity, riddled with uncertainty, and subject to the whims, temperaments and follies of human beings who make and apply it. And yet, as I also came to realize, it has often worked well. The Western legal tradition, upon which the Canadian system is based, has protected individual autonomy better than any other legal system in history. The problem is that for decades that tradition, and the culture from whence it came, have slowly been eroding. And now, during COVID, when the law has let us down, there is a tide in the affairs of Canadians. Late last week, three colleagues and I launched the Free North Declaration , a call to defend civil liberties in this country, which lawyers and members of the public are invited to endorse. So far more than 6,000 have done so, including over 100 lawyers. The declaration outlines the ways in which legal authorities - legislatures, governments, public health officials, professional regulators, administrative bodies and public institutions - have restricted Canadians' liberties during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have done so shrewdly, to attempt to remain inside the strict letter of the law and to avoid triggering protections in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Over the past year and a half, legal challenges to lockdowns and quarantines have mostly failed in the courts, whose decisions have largely embraced governments' COVID narratives. Canada was in trouble as soon as COVID hit. ""Crises are an ideal time for the state to advance into territory from which it will not wish to retreat,"" I wrote in the Financial Post in April 2020. ""In this new era, we will discover that leaders of all political stripes have more than a little Lenin in them."" It is 20 months since ""two weeks to flatten the curve,"" and Canadians' liberties are under siege like never before. Canadians' liberties are under siege like never before It may not seem that way if you are double-vaccinated and going to restaurants and concerts again, but keeping your hall pass will require booster shots on schedule. The caring arms of the pharmaceutical industry and public health are now reaching out to protect kids from nonexistent risk. The purpose of vaccine passports, authorities have acknowledged, is not to control spread of the virus, which vaccinated and unvaccinated both can do, but to pressure people to get jabbed. How much and for how long vaccines reduce the risk of infection are in dispute. Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has no record of any unvaccinated person spreading COVID after recovering from it. Masking persists everywhere, along with the idea upon which this tragedy began: Governments must keep us safe from viruses and the vicissitudes of life. The panic-demic did not start the fraying of the Western legal tradition, which has been underway for decades. In 1975, Prof. Harold Berman lamented that the idea that law transcends politics and is distinct from the state - a feature of that tradition - had ""yielded to the view that law is at all times basically an instrument of the state, a means of effecting the will of those who exercise political authority."" The instrumentalist, managerial state runs on the arrogance of experts, who believe that ordinary people cannot make their way in the world without direction from them. As Friedrich Hayek wrote, ""there could hardly be a more unbearable - and more irrational - world than one in which the most eminent specialists in each field were allowed to proceed unchecked with the realization of their ideals."" But experts now have control, and they do not plan to give it up. More On This Topic Raymond J. de Souza: Government overreach on COVID measures has been about power - not the pandemic Bruce Pardy: Even in a COVID snitch society, surveilling your judge is wrong No longer does the individual have the right to act without regard for ""public good."" Instead, authorities will return the freedom to make your own choices only when it is safe to do so. While we were sleeping, the individual became subordinate to the collective. People are apt to believe that the law will save them when things go bad, but simply taking cases to court won't fix this. The law is subject to cultural tides and currents, and when the culture goes askew, the law will provide little refuge. Alone, the Free North Declaration will change nothing. It will not influence omnipotent moral busybodies exercising tyranny for the good of its victims, as C.S. Lewis put it. Nor will it move people comfortable with giving up responsibility for their own decisions. Instead, the declaration is for those who see that something is not right in this country, and who need to know that others see it, too - and that there are still lawyers who will stand up for their freedoms. As Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn wrote, let each of us make a choice: ""Whether consciously, to remain a servant of falsehood - of course, it is not out of inclination, but to feed one's family, that one raises his children in the spirit of lies - or to shrug off the lies and become an honest man worthy of respect … And he who is not sufficiently courageous even to defend his soul - don't let him be proud of his ""progressive"" views, don't let him boast that he is an academician or a people's artist, a merited figure, or a general - let him say to himself: I am in the herd, and a coward. It's all the same to me as long as I'm fed and warm."" When the tide comes, we must take the current or lose the country. Please join us in the voyage of our lives. National Post Bruce Pardy is the executive director of Rights Probe and a professor of law at Queen's University. Twitter @PardyBruce Free North Declaration We are Canadian lawyers. In our country, civil liberties are under unprecedented attack. Governments, public health authorities, universities, public and private employers, municipalities, and businesses are trampling Canadians' rights and freedoms. Our free society is at risk. COVID rules restrict citizens' abilities to work, shop, travel and socialize. They erode civil liberties strategically, attempting to not run afoul of the law or to trigger protections in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms such as liberty and security of the person, the freedoms of association, assembly, expression, conscience, religion, and mobility rights. Where COVID rules appear to have violated the Charter, courts have deferred to the state to take whatever measures it deems necessary, whether demonstrably justifiable or not. Legislatures have passed statutes that delegate broad discretionary powers to unelected public health officials, who then create draconian legal restrictions by fiat, without public scrutiny or open debate. These directives give private and public employers cover to suspend and dismiss workers who insist on their right to decide their own medical treatments. In our system of law, no principle is more important than the right to control your own body and to make your own medical and health decisions. An anxious populace, swept up in a deliberate campaign of fear, now believes that individual liberties upon which our liberal democracy is founded are dangerous and selfish. A growing collectivism that demands safety at the expense of autonomy shapes public policy. Courts have embraced the pandemic narrative, some taking judicial notice of the nature of risks of the virus and safety of vaccines to adults and children. But the facts are anything but settled. Courts are supposed to be neutral. On COVID, as on any other contentious subject, their mandate is to find facts exclusively upon the evidence adduced by the parties in the courtroom. Instead, courts appear to have taken a side on COVID. Access to justice and the rule of law are now at risk. Unvaccinated persons are banned from juries, throwing into question the ability of all to obtain a fair trial heard by a jury of their peers. Irrational policies born of panic affect no one more than disadvantaged communities who already suffer from lack of access to justice. The right to privacy and control of personal medical information has been abandoned. Disclosure of vaccination status is becoming a requirement for working, travelling, entering public and private establishments, crossing the border, and sometimes medical treatment. Those who cannot or will not disclose face aggressive social disapprobation. Vaccine passports create the infrastructure for a global digital surveillance system. Institutions that last year were prohibited from collecting individual medical history now demand it as a condition of employment or admission. University and college students are being denied their education for refusing to disclose their own medical choices. Medical regulators have become dictatorial. They have warned doctors not to express medical opinions that might conflict with official COVID policies, effectively censoring them, and directed them not to certify grounds for medical exemptions from vaccination requirements, rupturing the physician-patient relationship and breaching the principle that only a practitioner who has examined a patient is equipped to give a diagnosis. Human rights commissions, which until recently championed expansive interpretations of human rights, have issued edicts narrowing grounds for accommodations. COVID rules are inconsistent and irrational. Authorities enforce them selectively and preferentially, coming down hard on common people while turning a blind eye to the privileged. COVID vaccines do not prevent people from becoming infected or from transmitting the virus to others, but only unvaccinated persons are banned or required to undergo testing. People who have recovered from COVID and therefore have natural immunity are still subject to vaccination mandates even though the purpose of vaccination is to mimic natural immunity. Governments, public health authorities and employers advise that COVID vaccinations are safe, but pharmaceutical companies have been granted immunity from liability and no employers will accept legal responsibility for side-effects or adverse events, whether minor or serious, suffered by their employees who take a vaccine that they do not want. The risks posed by COVID vaccines may be in dispute, but they are not zero. Particularly for children and healthy young adults, they may be riskier than the virus. We fear the erosion of our free society. We question the single-minded fixation on a virus that poses little risk to most people. We protest the uncalculated harms that COVID policies are causing to people's health, livelihoods, relationships, and mental states. We oppose the mass hysteria and anxiety that governments and the media are fuelling. Most of all, we object to the deterioration of our civil liberties and the failure of our legal institutions - legislatures, governments, administrative bodies, and courts - to protect them. We are appalled by what is happening in our country. We call for the immediate end of vaccine passports and mandates. We propose a public inquiry into the handling of all aspects of the declared pandemic. Canadians should have control of their own lives and have the right to make their own decisions about their health, medical treatments, personal information, travels, and associations. Canada is supposed to be a free country governed by the rule of law. Restore it now or risk losing it for good. Original signatories: Bruce Pardy, LLB, LLM. Lisa Bildy, JD, BA. W.

"FUREY: Ontario hitting 1,000 cases isn't the big deal it used to be",https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/furey-ontario-hitting-1000-cases-just-isnt-the-big-deal-it-used-to-be,torontosun.com,"News on Friday that Ontario was again reporting more than 1,000 new daily COVID-19 cases was met with predictable cries that we must ""do something.""",['Anthony Furey'],2021-12-03 00:00:00,"FUREY: Ontario hitting 1,000 cases just isn't the big deal it used to be FUREY: Ontario hitting 1,000 cases just isn't the big deal it used to be Photo by Evan Buhler / THE CANADIAN PRESS The news on Friday that Ontario had once again crossed the threshold of reporting 1,000 new daily cases of COVID-19 was met with predictable cries from some corners that we are now presented with an urgent problem that compels us to ""do something"" - that ""something"" being the restricting, in some way or another, of our daily lives. But before we leap back into something hasty that, until 2020, was unprecedented and completely against what the public health textbooks argued for, maybe we should pause and consider how things are different now than they were during Ontario's second or third waves. FUREY: Ontario hitting 1,000 cases just isn't the big deal it used to be Maybe we don't need to freak out at the news of 1,000 cases per day, or even 2,000 or 3,000 cases per day. Back during previous waves, which briefly hit 4,000 cases per day, humans just weren't coming into contact with each other all that much. The province had been heavily restricted throughout the second and third waves. Ontario was either in total or regional lockdown or, for those that were out of it, many activities were closed or subjected to major capacity restrictions. Based on how much our activities were limited, it was in some ways remarkable that the virus was getting around as much as it was back then. Things are different now. Pretty much everything is a go and firing on all cylinders. Every day, millions of Ontarians are in prolonged close contact with each other - heading to a concert or a sporting event, going out for lunch with others or just sitting around a conference table at work. It really shouldn't be a surprise then that as traditional cold and flu season kicks in, this virus also rises, given the sheer volume of human contact that's going on. So far, the ratio of contacts to infections seem so much less significant than earlier this year. Then there's the fact that vaccines weren't around for Ontario's second wave and were only beginning to be widely rolled out during the third wave. (I also hate to be the snitch here, but it's time to acknowledge that mask compliance in Ontario is only high in places where it's enforced, like in the grocery store or schools. Otherwise, many people have ditched masks in indoor settings.) Any skittish Ontarians among us should also look around them and see that others aren't panicking. New York state is currently clocking in over 6,000 cases per day. Their population is only about 25% greater than Ontario's, yet their daily case count is multiple times greater. Yet they're not suddenly scrambling to lock themselves down. The same comparison can be made with other neighbouring states. It's true that American hospital capacity is in much better shape than ours. But Ontario taxpayers shell out good money for our system to be managed effectively. Our hospital administrators are paid big bucks. Their job is to solve these issues internally, not to squawk on publicly about lockdowns and school closures. This obsession with case counts has got to go. Dr. Kieran Moore, Ontario's top doctor, has previously encouraged the public and media to stop fixating so heavily on case counts. Instead, we're encouraged to look at hospitalization numbers. And, right now, ICU numbers for COVID-19 are lower than they were throughout all of September. Anything can happen. Things change. But, right now, it seems like 1,000 cases per day in Ontario just isn't the big deal it used to be. afurey@postmedia.com Your Midday Sun From our newsroom to your inbox at noon, the latest headlines, stories, opinion and photos from the Toronto Sun.

Tristin Hopper: Canada's COVID-19 lockdowns have lost all touch with reality,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/tristin-hopper-canadian-covid-19-restrictions-have-lost-all-touch-with-reality,nationalpost.com,COVID-19 is now killing fewer Canadians per day than the daily average from pneumonia and the flu,['Tristin Hopper'],2021-06-19 00:00:00,"Photo by Ian Willms/Getty Images/File When University of Toronto professor Richard Florida and his wife, Rana Florida, drove up to the Michigan-Ontario border last week, they had months of peer-reviewed epidemiological science on their side to show that they posed virtually no COVID risk to the people of Canada. The Government of Canada did not care. The couple was forced into mandatory 14-day home quarantine and supervised by ""10 or 20"" phone calls per day from quarantine officers - as well as regular in-person visits. It seems like you would want to deploy those resources better than just sort of being a pest ""It seems like you would want to deploy those resources better than just sort of being a pest,"" Florida told the National Post. Florida is but one of thousands of people now caught in a latticework of Canadian COVID-19 restrictions that have ceased to have any relationship to reality. As COVID-19 goes into full retreat across the country, Canadian governments are stubbornly adhering to restrictions that are not only pointless, but incur a daily tithe of debt, closed businesses and lockdown-related fatalities. At a time when Canada should be casting off the shackles of one of its most damaging single events, entrenched interests seem bent on seeing it continue. .@ranaflorida & I just got a visit from Canadian public health authorities checking on our quarantine. We are now being observed doing our Day 8 online Covid test. We are both fully vaccinated. Is it crazy to think such precious public health resources could be put to better use - Richard Florida (@Richard_Florida) June 16, 2021 Canada now has one of the lowest rates of per-capita COVID-19 fatalities in the entire G20. At the end of this week, the average citizen of the European Union is now 61 per cent more likely to die of COVID-19 than the average Canadian, even though the case rates in both places are roughly the same . The rise of the Delta variant has spurred worry, but early data out of the U.K. suggest the vaccines are as effective at preventing hospitalization from this variant as any other. COVID-free for the first time since March 26, 2020! 🎉 This is the first time the MSICU at Toronto General does not have any COVID patients. We are very grateful for the extraordinary MSICU team! #ThankYou pic.twitter.com/LGmNsF8snY - University Health Network (@UHN) June 16, 2021 On every front, Canada's pandemic is speeding towards its end: A fast-tracked and innovative national vaccine strategy has bought Canadians deliverance from COVID-19 faster than almost anyone thought possible. The country now has the world's second-highest rate of first-dose vaccine coverage, and 4.8 million people are now fully vaccinated - including half of all Canadians over the age of 80 . The country's reward for this epidemiological miracle? A continued lockdown on commerce and civic life that, in many ways, is indistinguishable from the summer of 2020, when a vaccine still seemed a distant pipe dream and more than two thirds of the country's 26,000 COVID fatalities had yet to die. For more than a year, schools have been identified around the world as negligible vectors for COVID-19 transmission, in large part because the virus has such a hard time sticking to children . Regardless, Ontario schools have remained under indefinite closure since April, despite even a May 29 statement from Ontario's own COVID-19 Science Advisory Table saying that the province ""can re-open schools safely."" The Government of Ontario had promised that as soon as 70 per cent of adults reached first-dose vaccination, the province would legalize hair salons, outdoor amusements and tables of up to six people at outdoor restaurants - all of which have been allowed for months in many other regions of North America. Even with Ontario now at 75 per cent vaccination coverage, a government-mandated interval of three weeks means that hair salons will continue to remain shuttered until July. ""Every single … hour lockdowns continue, more small business owners make the decision to close their doors forever,"" Dan Kelly, CEO of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, wrote in a Thursday Tweet. Every single day, hour lockdowns continue, more small business owners make the decision to close their doors forever. Yes, there is light at the end of the tunnel, but the capacity for small firms to hang on is extremely limited. - Dan Kelly (@CFIB) June 17, 2021 But the most overzealous COVID strictures can be found at the Canadian border. The federal government has put in plans to lift its mandatory quarantine for fully vaccinated travellers - but not until July. And even then, incoming travellers must continue to provide two negative COVID-19 tests regardless of vaccination status - a requirement well beyond the pale of almost any other Western nation. As a renowned urban theorist, Florida can usually be heard talking up his adoptive Toronto home as a haven for what he calls the ""creative class"" - the scientists, engineers, tech investors and others who help invigorate urban economies. Now, as Florida's usual world of conferences, summits and book tours start up again, he faces fines and even jail time if he so much as steps outside for a walk before his quarantine ends on Tuesday. He suspects he's not the only one thinking hard about whether it's still possible for him to do his job from Canadian soil. Yup same story, we are on day 13 of quarantine and tomorrow is our last day. An official actually showed up on day 7. He agreed with us that it is pointless we are quarantining despite being fully vaccinated (and 2 negative tests), but he is just doing his job 🤦🏾‍♂️ - Avinash Collis (@avi_collis) June 15, 2021 ""This is literally like hanging out a sign and saying ‘global talent, we're kind of on the fence about you,'"" he told the National Post. Canada's hesitance on reopening also risks leaving whole sectors of the economy out of the global rebound, including the country's $100 billion-per-year tourism industry . As early as February, Poland lifted its quarantine requirements for fully vaccinated tourists. France opened its borders to vaccinated visitors earlier this month. As of this writing, more than 30 countries are jumpstarting their tourism industries with special provisions for vaccinated travellers - particularly those from the heavily vaccinated U.S. Canada, by contrast, just extended its non-essential travel ban with the U.S. until at least July 21 , ostensibly to keep ""Canadians safe,"" according to a statement by Minister of Public Safety Bill Blair. The borders similarly remain closed to everyone else looking to take a Canadian vacation, regardless of their vaccination status. ""You can't enter Canada for discretionary travel,"" reads a blunt declaration on the Government of Canada's official information page for foreign visitors. Our number one priority as we fight #COVID19 is keeping Canadians safe. In coordination with the U.S., we are extending restrictions on non-essential international travel and with the United States until July 21st, 2021. - Bill Blair (@BillBlair) June 18, 2021 Not only is this shutting out yet another summer for Canada's bankruptcy-plagued tourism sector, but it risks permanently altering long-established travel patterns. Canada's refusal to reopen its ports to even fully vaccinated cruise vessels, for instance, has spurred a legislative push in the U.S. to encourage cruise operators to bypass Canadian ports permanently . ""Canada cannot afford to be left behind as other countries around the world begin to reopen,"" Susie Grynol, president of the Hotel Association of Canada, said in a statement this week . But while overzealous Canadian lockdowns may be progressively losing touch with scientific evidence, it would be wrong to say that they're necessarily against public opinion. A June 9 poll by Maru Public Opinion found that 69 per cent of Ontarians approved of school closures. And despite living within North America's most locked-down jurisdiction, half approved of the performance of Premier Doug Ford. An Angus Reid Institute poll released the same day wasn't nearly as warm towards Ford, but it nevertheless found that Ontarians approved of his performance on COVID more than any other single file, including the economy, healthcare and education. As the U.S. crawls out of its pandemic, American communities have reached out to Canadians with a wave of good neighbourliness. Communities in Alaska, Montana and Washington State have even offered extra vaccine doses to Canadian towns across the border to speed up reopening. The Blackfeet Nation in Montana gifted their surplus COVID-19 vaccines (750 doses) to nearby residents in Alberta, Canada. People drove for hours and lined up for miles on the highway to be vaccinated at a mobile clinic set up at the border crossing. pic.twitter.com/7gdjVYvT9F - CeeJay Yellow Hawk (@AdriftAlchemist) May 2, 2021 Canadians, in contrast, have seemed unusually willing to seal off outsiders for as long as possible. Last month, Ontario premier Doug Ford said his province could not afford to watch the fourth wave of COVID-19 "" walk across our border ."" Last July in B.C., following a rash of vandalism on cars bearing U.S. licence plates, Premier John Horgan told Americans that if they didn't like it they should ride the bus . Only three weeks ago, an Angus Reid Institute poll found that more than half of Canadians continued to favour a total ban on international arrivals . Said Florida, himself American-born with two dual-citizen children, COVID-19 ""exposed something I had never seen and would rather not see."" • Email: thopper@postmedia.com | Twitter: TristinHopper NP Posted Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the National Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

EDITORIAL: Take a deep breath over omicron,https://torontosun.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-take-a-deep-breath-over-omicron,torontosun.com,"“I want us all to remain calm.” Those words were spoken Monday morning, by Ontario’s chief medical officer Dr. Kieran Moore.",['Postmedia News'],2021-11-29 00:00:00,"""We need more information on the severity,"" Dr. Moore said, and added that they'd be curious to know ""if it's a less lethal virus."" While some people may be understandably under the impression that this new variant is much worse than previous incarnations of COVID-19, there is currently no evidence to back that up and no credible person has actually yet made such a claim. Dr. Moore's words were not unique that to him. Other medical authorities were sounding similar notes via the news and social media, especially those based out of southern Africa - where the variant was first identified. He was speaking at a press conference concerning the confirmation that the omicron variant of COVID-19 has been identified in Ontario. Canadian health authorities are not claiming that omicron is deadlier or that it evades vaccines or even that it's more transmissible. A lot of people might think otherwise, based on some of the wild speculation that is out there. ""I don't foresee us having to take any steps back at present,"" Dr. Moore said, when asked about increasing rather than relaxing the province's restrictions. ""We're not looking at further public health measures or mandates."" Let's hope this message of calm spreads across the country. Other provinces will no doubt soon learn about cases of this variant cropping up in their neck of the woods. They should keep Dr. Moore's sobering words in mind when this happens. If we do indeed find ourselves facing some version of COVID-19 that evades vaccines and is much more problematic than what we were dealing with now, then we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Right now, we just don't know if that's the case or not so we can't turn our lives upside under the assumption that it is. Do we undertake preventative measures? Sure. Do we proceed with caution? Sure. But we still proceed. We mustn't be in such a state of panic that we will ourselves into a state of perpetual rolling lockdowns for the foreseeable future over uncertain risk. Let's all take a collective deep breath."
Raymond J. de Souza: Government overreach on COVID measures has been about power - not the pandemic,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/raymond-j-de-souza-government-overreach-on-vaccines-has-been-about-power-not-the-pandemic,nationalpost.com,It's a very ancient infection to which state agents are prone and for which no effective cure has been developed,['Father Raymond J. De Souza'],2021-10-23 00:00:00,"Raymond J. de Souza: Government overreach on COVID measures has been about power - not the pandemic Raymond J. de Souza: Government overreach on COVID measures has been about power - not the pandemic Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post I have raised the issue of government overreach in relation to vaccine mandates. Respectful readers have asked whether that gives comfort to those who oppose the vaccines themselves. Is favouring vaccination but blanching at punitive vaccine mandates too fine a line? Might it discourage people from getting vaccinated? That may be the case. I further concede that, alongside reasonable arguments against overreach from thoughtful people with genuine concerns, there are some crackpots. The pandemic has produced a lot of odd behaviour, whether it be conspiracists in their basements or motorists wearing masks while driving alone in their vehicles. Raymond J. de Souza: Government overreach on COVID measures has been about power - not the pandemic Nevertheless, overreach in the promotion of a positive measure - vaccination - still remains overreach. It is possible that overreach may hamper vaccination, too; at least some who decline vaccination do so as a political protest against the expansion of state power. A more restrained state might persuade some of them that no great skulduggery is afoot. It is possible that overreach may hamper vaccination, too Recent developments have suggested that such overreach is not a bug, but a feature. Not a reluctantly embraced necessary evil, but malice aforethought. What if the point was no longer containment of the pandemic but to extend the reach of the state, pure and simple? Consider four examples. For nearly six months, Dr. Bonnie Henry simply abolished religious liberty in British Columbia. Her edict permitted people to meet for an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in the church basement, but that same number of people could not meet in the much larger church to pray. It wasn't about regulating meetings, but banning worship. When the matter was brought before the courts, the judge shrugged his shoulders. Yes, the order violated all of the fundamental freedoms listed in the Charter of Rights, but in an emergency the public health officials could do whatever they wanted, independent of changing circumstances or variance between regions. Photo by DON CRAIG/GOVERNMENT OF B.C./PNG What if the point of Henry's order was not public health, but to expand the power of her office, exploiting the pandemic to give her office the ability to grant itself an auto-exemption to the Constitution? Even if that wasn't the point, it was the result. A few weeks ago in Ontario, the government announced that thousands of cheering fans could sit cheek-by-largely-unmasked-jowl at a Maple Leafs game, but a 10-person diner in Kapuskasing could serve only half that number. What was the point of that, which had no basis in public health? Could it be that the government, by strangling the diners and cafes of Ontario for a few extra weeks, wished to remind the tens of thousands of restaurateurs in the province that their livelihood was in the power of the state to grant or withhold? This month in Edmonton, Justice A. W. Germain sentenced the pastor of a small church and his brother for violating public health orders with manifest contumacy, handing down tens of thousands of dollars in fines based what courts had done in Ontario. More On This Topic Raymond J. de Souza: A compelling critique of Ontario's vaccine mandates John Ivison: House of Commons vaccine mandate tramples over rights of MPs Germain then went further, issuing what even the bailiff could recognize as an egregiously unconstitutional order. If Pastor Artur Pawlowski wishes to preach upon pandemic measures in the future, he will have to say the following: ""I am also aware that the views I am expressing to you on this occasion may not be views held by the majority of medical experts in Alberta. While I may disagree with them, I am obliged to inform you that the majority of medical experts favour social distancing, mask wearing, and avoiding large crowds to reduce the spread of COVID-19. …"" Of course the judge knows that forcing people to say what they do not wish to say - and do not believe - violates all the fundamental freedoms of the Charter. It is what tyrants do. Courts for that reason do not compel rapists to apologize to their victims. What if the point of the sentence was not justice, but to aggregate to judges the power to force preachers and activists to say what the state wishes them to say? Any number of emergencies could be imagined in which that bit of statist coercion might prove convenient. Germain, in a rather windy judgment, did not say whether he took note that, on the very eve of his hearing the Pawlowski case in September, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau held a packed, sweaty campaign rally in Brampton, Ont. Perhaps he did not find it germane. But the message from the court was clear. If your speech is favoured by the government, then there are no binding rules, let alone charges. If it is not, there are serious fines, and confiscation of fundamental liberties. The message from the court was clear Finally, the Speaker of the House of Commons, in his capacity as chairman of the internal administration committee known as the Board of Internal Economy, delivered this week a nighttime ukase barring unvaccinated MPs from taking their seats in the chamber. That he was acting beyond his power is not seriously in dispute. But Anthony Rota knew that pandemic politics trump the law and centuries of parliamentary privilege. The diktat was intended to make the Conservative party uneasy, and within days Erin O'Toole fell in line, playing his customary role of adopting Liberal policies after a modest deliberation over what degree of enthusiasm to show for them. So the Speaker expands his power, awarding himself the power to bar MPs from the chamber without the House being able to express itself. Even a modest humility might have prompted Rota, elected speaker in a parliament now dissolved, to await election of a new speaker before abusing the power of the office. It bears constant repeating that Canada is a high vaccination country, one of the highest in the world. In Alberta, vaccine averse relative to the rest of Canada, more than 78 per cent of all those over age 12 are fully vaccinated, with over 86 per cent partially vaccinated. Given the demographic distribution of the province, that means more than 90 per cent in Calgary. Those are world-best rates. Canada's vaccination record means that government pandemic overreach is more about government than the pandemic. Health bureaucrats, provincial cabinets, judges, officers of parliament - all are using the pandemic to expand their power. That is a very ancient infection to which state agents are prone. For that, even over the course of millennia, no effective vaccine has been developed. National Post The big issues are far from settled. Sign up for the NP Comment newsletter, NP Platformed.

High vaccination rates protect the elderly and adults with comorbidities, who face a much higher risk of hospitalization and death than children. However, despite the accumulation of massive amounts of reassuring scientific data, the public continues to worry that COVID-19 poses a risk to children. Unfortunately, because of this, children are continuing to face strict restrictions in schools and sports, causing significant harms. Most children who contract the virus are asymptomatic. According to the Murdoch Children's Research Institute , ""Children and adolescents who have COVID-19 will commonly have no or only mild symptoms, similar to a cold."" According to a pre-print study that compiled multi-country data, the chance a child will be hospitalized if infected is between one in 500 and one in 1,000. Yet even this risk may be an overestimate: according to a study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal , nearly 40 per cent of children who were considered hospitalized with COVID-19 in 2020 were there for unrelated reasons. Furthermore, data from Public Health England found that unvaccinated children are at a lower risk of hospitalization when compared with fully vaccinated 40-49-year-olds. And the delta variant, while more transmissible, does not appear to cause more severe disease in children or adults . We must put COVID-19's pediatric mortality risk into context: according to U.S. Centres for Disease Control (CDC) data for 5-14 year-olds, motor vehicle accidents and suicide are each responsible for 10 times and 7 times the number of deaths than from COVID, respectively. The 700 American children whose deaths have been attributed to COVID-19 since January 2020 is less than the number of youth influenza deaths in the 2017-18 and 2018-19 seasons combined. A study from England of the 3,105 childhood deaths during the first 12 months of the pandemic found that only 25 of those deaths were due to COVID-19 - equivalent to a COVID-19 mortality rate of two per million children. Of these, over 75 per cent had co-morbidities and 60 per cent had a life-limiting condition, meaning it is important to identify the children at highest risk, prioritize them for vaccination and understand what works best to protect them. Lasting COVID-19 symptoms is a potential concern for children. However, long COVID definitions include over 200 symptoms, many of which are nonspecific and common among kids who have not been infected with COVID-19. Despite sensational media claims that long COVID may develop in up to a quarter of infected children, recent studies with adequate sample sizes and control groups have shown that long COVID is much more rare in this population. For example, the Office of National Statistics in the United Kingdom found the prevalence of persistent symptoms 12-16 weeks after a SARS-CoV-2 infection to be no different between infected and uninfected children. Another study found that four per cent of children who tested positive reported at least one symptom lasting beyond 12 weeks, but this also happened in two per cent of the control subjects. It is now apparent that school closures have had negative consequences that will shape a generation. A recent report in the Health and Human Rights Journal described school closures as violating basic rights to quality of education and nutrition, predominantly affecting students with special needs and from low-income families. Numerous studies, including data from Vancouver , show that schools do not play a major role in viral spread. Likewise, studies show that teachers are not at a higher risk from COVID-19 than those working in other professions. However, the collateral damage from prolonged school closures and other restrictions has been significant. Important risk factors for severe disease or death from COVID in children, such as obesity and Type 2 diabetes , have dramatically increased. Mental health disorders are also rising, including significant increases in pediatric eating disorders . In the United States, emergency room visits for children with mental-health related concerns increased by 24 per cent (ages 5-11) and 31 per cent (ages 12-17) during the pandemic. Youth thinking of or attempting suicide also increased dramatically. An educational analysis by McKinsey and Company indicated that K-12 students were on average five months behind in mathematics and four months behind in reading, with students of colour being most greatly impacted in all grade levels. Even three month school closures may leave students behind by a full year over the long term and, based on data from Second World War school closures, could affect their earning potential 40 years down the road. There are also growing concerns of detrimental impacts on language development and well-being from long-term masking in children. A large observational pre-print study analyzing data from the COVID-19 School Response Dashboard did not find any correlations between COVID-19 rates and mask mandates. Another study out of Spain failed to find any increase in COVID-19 cases in kids under six years old, who all remained unmasked, compared to older cohorts, which were required to wear masks. Students with English as a second language, autism, hearing loss or speech and language delay are the most negatively impacted by continued masking in schools, as are children with behavioural challenges. That in some schools children are required to mask outdoors, while running or playing sports, shows just how inhumane and unrealistic these mandates can be. Of note, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control does not recommend masks for children in primary school and only recommends face masks for children over 12 years old in secondary schools situated in areas with community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The recent Health Canada approval of the Pfizer vaccine for children ages 5 to 11 is good news, as long as it is used to support, and not further restrict, children. It is important to leave space for families to make informed decisions based on their personal contexts, and not to use this as an opportunity to impose vaccine mandates on school children. School-based COVID-19 vaccine mandates could unintentionally result in widening socioeconomic disparities. If mandates are imposed, children of parents who wish to wait for additional vaccine safety data stand to pay a very large price for a decision that's entirely out of their hands. Children who will inevitably be pulled from the public school system because of vaccination mandates could miss out on critical academic and athletic opportunities, in addition to being separated from their friends and established social networks. In fact, in its recommendation of the pediatric vaccine, the National Advisory Committee for Immunization stated, ""Given the short-term uncertainties surrounding pediatric vaccination at this time, children and their parents or guardians should be supported and respected in their decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccinations for the child, whatever decisions they make, and should not be stigmatized for accepting, or not accepting, the vaccination offer."" When it comes to children and COVID-19, the data are reassuring. Coming together to do the best thing for our children should involve an honest and apolitical look at the science, including both the risks to children from COVID-19 as well as the risks from disease mitigation measures. The latter also pose serious short- and long-term health risks, especially for children with special needs and those from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. Given that all adults now have access to effective vaccines that will protect them against severe outcomes, it is time to finally focus on what is best for our children and allow them to have a rapid return to normalcy.

It's a well-intentioned line that's hard to refute and generally serves as good advice. But somewhere along the way, levelheadedness turned emotional, and quests for transparency and truth turned dogmatic. Many people's dedication to science began to resemble something decidedly unscientific: religion. Following the science should be an intellectual exercise, but it's become one in which regular people seek comfort and affirmation during an undeniably difficult time. Like traditional religions, that comfort is found in rituals, personal and collective sacrifice, and moral judgments on purity. Anyone who questions or critiques public health responses -- which may be based on science, but are subjective decisions -- are often cast as heretics. Rigorously cleaning and sanitizing surfaces we've long known aren't major sources of transmission is largely a comfort ritual. Erecting plastic barriers that may actually worsen ventilation is also often about psychological reassurance. Wearing masks as you walk to your table in a small restaurant, but not for the next two hours as you eat, drink and socialize, is not just ritualistic, but a theatrical display. The same goes for QR code menus and directional stickers in aisles. These things may look like science, sound like science, and even feel like science, but they're stretching what science actually demands. On social media, what began as an honest pursuit of knowledge and hard data created new communities and infallible idols during a period of isolation. One of the fundamental roles of churches and other places of worship is to provide social organization and connection. Pews are replaced with follower counts, and collective hymns with retweets and memes. The main connection between these communities and their newly popular leaders is an often uncritical dedication to following the so-called science and demanding others adhere to it. Straying from the flock is discouraged; ""doing your own research"" has become something to mock. Historically, religions thrive during times of crisis. Polling shows that the faith of many religious Americans was strengthened during the pandemic, even as their places of worship closed. Google searches for ""prayer"" have spiked worldwide. But the reality is that traditional religion is in decline, and more people than ever consider themselves agnostic, atheist or simply nonpracticing. However, the psychological needs served by religion during crises remain; people still crave comfort, community and a sense of control. Science became many of these non-believers' de facto religion; something to cling to, worship and help make sense of it all. There would be little harm in this, if it weren't for the fact that science is actually important and perverting it to serve our psychological and social needs poses obvious dangers. It risks clouding our collective decision-making and ultimately undermining the trustworthiness of truly objective facts and data. To be clear, our understanding of science can and should evolve as we learn more. One week's objective fact may not be next week's objective fact. But much of the same crowd that lectures others on accepting changing science has a glaring blind spot: the science changes, but their own mindsets and judgments don't, particularly when it comes to conflating hygiene theatre and moral virtue. Their pandemic approach remains decidedly Old Testament, steeped in sacrifice and a punitive worldview. We're convinced we're in a period of enlightenment, but our reality increasingly hews closer to the Middle Ages, when science was seen as a way to reinforce theological and moral beliefs rather than a pure pursuit of knowledge. It's no secret that religions have an unfortunate habit of being hijacked by those with ulterior motives, whether that be political or personal power, or the pursuit of wealth and fame. It'd be naive to think opportunists and bad actors aren't already trying to capitalize on the blind faith and moral rigidity of the most hardcore ""follow the science"" worshippers. This is why, going forward, questioning what's presented to the public as science is more important than ever. National Post The big issues are far from settled.

Rupa Subramanya: Why won't Trudeau let Canadians return to a life of normalcy?,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/rupa-subramanya-why-wont-trudeau-let-canadians-return-to-a-life-of-normalcy,nationalpost.com,It is starting to feel as if the government is reluctant to give up its control over our lives,['Rupa Subramanya'],2021-07-16 00:00:00,"Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post After a slow and stumbling start, COVID-19 vaccination rollout in Canada has achieved remarkable success. With 70 per cent of Canadians having received a first dose and 47 per cent now fully vaccinated, Canada is poised to overtake the United States in the next few days. By the time you read this, it will likely have already happened. However, unlike in the U.S., Europe and the U.K., federal officials in Canada have been exceedingly slow in planning for a return to normalcy. It was only on July 15 that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau broadly hinted that the U.S.-Canada land border would reopen to fully vaccinated Americans in mid-August , and made a rather more vague suggestion that air travel may reopen to vaccinated international tourists in early September, assuming the current progress in vaccination continues. This is far from a definitive announcement. One positive step thus far is that fully vaccinated passengers arriving by air can now enter Canada without the need for a mandatory quarantine assuming that they have passed a COVID-19 screening before their travel and again upon arrival. At present, the land border between Canada and the U.S. remains closed except to essential travellers, the longest such closure in peacetime history. This is despite protestations from the travel and tourism industry and legislators from Midwestern American states. Perhaps Trudeau's announcement was prompted by such pressures. The longest such border closure in peacetime history The French government has protested Canada's policy, saying there is no scientific reason for blocking travellers who are fully vaccinated and tested. Meanwhile, the Indian High Commission in Ottawa has protested Canada's continuing ban on direct flights from India. The ban was imposed April 22 in response to the Delta variant originating in India. After nearly three months, the continuing flight suspension is perplexing, given the high vaccination rate in Canada and the fact that the Delta variant is no longer confined to India but has spread throughout the world. What is more, Canada refuses to recognize COVID-19 molecular test results conducted in India. This, plus the continuing flight ban forces returning passengers - including Canadian citizens and permanent residents - to travel via expensive and circuitous time-consuming routes that transit through one or more additional countries before being allowed to return to Canada. The Canadian government has in effect outsourced any potential risks of passengers returning from India to third countries. It makes little sense that India has been singled out for this treatment, a country where despite a slow start, vaccinations too are on the rise and cases are falling. While the flight suspension made sense in April, and I in fact argued for it before it happened, it doesn't make much sense now. Leaving aside Australia and New Zealand, which are pursuing a ""zero COVID-19 strategy"" with a hard border, Canada remains the only major country that makes it excruciatingly painful and expensive for its own citizens and residents to return home from India. The larger problem is that the federal government appears to have no serious plan for a return to normalcy after the pandemic. Hints of a future reopening do not amount to a road map. By saying that vaccine passports fall under provincial jurisdiction, Trudeau has abdicated the federal government's responsibility in setting a sensible national policy that would facilitate travel both between provinces and at the international borders. Meanwhile, other countries are forging ahead with post pandemic planning, and several European countries already have a functioning system of vaccine passports that facilitates travel and access to indoor events such as concerts. More On This Topic Rupa Subramanya: Church fires show the left's disgusting propensity to turn a blind eye to violence Rupa Subramanya: To those who chose to come here, cancelling Canada Day seems utterly bizarre In many policy areas, there's a case to be made for decentralization, but that shouldn't apply to recovery from a global pandemic that has crippled normal life in Canada for close to a year and a half. The Trudeau government has spent billions of dollars helping workers and businesses during successive lockdowns, but it has peculiarly refused to assert its authority in setting guidelines on a return to normalcy. We had the peculiar situation where residents of Ontario were living under the longest continuous lockdown of any major country, while other provinces such as Alberta had more or less fully reopened. Ontario has finally reopened indoor dining and gyms as of July 16. Prime Minister Trudeau seems remarkably reluctant to embrace the post pandemic world and allow Canadians to return to a life of normalcy, with only recent hints that things may change. Caution was abundantly justified when our vaccination rate was low, but at this point, it is starting to feel as if the government is reluctant to give up its control over our lives. The fact that such continued controls as the Canada-U.S. border closure are polling well suggests what Trudeau's motivations may be. After all, if you're gearing up for a fall election, you'll likely do what you think the voters want, before then asking for their vote. It will be interesting to see whether a fall election call will come hard on the heels of reopening the borders, or perhaps the reverse. National Post The big issues are far from settled.

Will they apologize for falsely labeling them as racists and acknowledge their own claims at the beginning of the pandemic that travel bans were ineffective were false? If travel bans - implemented until at least Jan. 31, 2022 - are justified now to protect Canadians, then they were justified at the start of the pandemic and the federal government failed to protect us by not acting until months later, haphazardly, when it was too late. On Friday, Transport Minister Omar Alghabra and Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos announced that foreign nationals travelling in South Africa, Eswatini, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Namibia within the last 14 days are barred from Canada. Canadians who have been in these countries in the last 14 days will face enhanced testing, screening and quarantine measures, regardless of vaccination status or having contracted and recovered from COVID, when they fly back to Canada. They must obtain, within 72 hours of departure, a valid negative COVID-19 test in a third country, before continuing to Canada. Upon arrival they will be subject to immediate testing, a second compulsory test on day 8 after their arrival and a quarantine period of 14 days. They will be required to stay in a designated quarantine facility to await initial test results and not permitted to leave until their quarantine plan has been approved and they have received a negative test result. Compare those measures to what was requested in a January 2020 petition by parents living in York region near Toronto - signed by 10,000 people, many of them of Chinese origin - at the start of the pandemic that was widely condemned at the time by federal, provincial and municipal politicians, public health officials, academics and pundits. In retrospect, what they were asking for, compared to what the Trudeau government is doing today, sounds quaint by comparison. After accurately describing the progress of the coronavirus in China at the time and accurately predicting the danger of global spread, the petition concluded: 1. ""We strongly need the School board (to) ask students and their families who travelled back from China to report to school and classroom teacher. The school should keep tracking status of the students who recently travelled to China (not just Wuhan, any city of China). Other parents of the class should have the right to know whether there are students in the class (who) came back from China recently, and have the right to decide whether to keep their kids at home. 2. ""We ask that the school board send out a communication to all parents requesting students who or whose families have recently returned from China, to stay at home and keep isolated for a minimum of 17 days for the purpose of self-quarantine. 3. ""Allow students to wear safety equipment including respirator masks during school. 4. ""For the safety of children and teachers, the school and classroom teachers should advise students to strictly follow safety guidelines to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus in school. The school should advise staff to do so as well."" As history has shown, the organizers of this petition weren't racists. They were right. lgoldstein@postmedia.com Your Midday Sun From our newsroom to your inbox at noon, the latest headlines, stories, opinion and photos from the Toronto Sun.

LILLEY: Ford gets vax mandate for health workers right,https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/lilley-ford-gets-vax-mandate-for-health-workers-right,torontosun.com,The Ford government will not impose a province-wide vaccine mandate on health workers.,['Brian Lilley'],2021-11-03 00:00:00,"Photo by Stock photo / Getty Images The government cited a high level of vaccinations among doctors, nurses, and other health workers as well as concerns about the impact mandated vaccinations would have on surgeries and other medical procedures. It's a sensible decision that puts a priority on patient care instead of a rigid demand that everyone get the jab. Opposition parties, the Ontario Medical Association, the Ontario Hospital Association, and others called for a province-wide government vaccine mandate, but on Wednesday, Premier Doug Ford said no. ""I am not prepared to jeopardize the delivery of care to millions of Ontarians,"" Ford said in a statement Wednesday. ""Having looked at the evidence, our government has decided to maintain its flexible approach by leaving human resourcing decisions up to individual hospitals."" As the Toronto Sun first reported three weeks ago, Ford sent a letter to hospital CEOs and other health executives asking them for their views on a government vaccine mandate for the sector. His letter also asked a number of direct questions on whether hospitals had plans for dealing with surgical backlogs and what impact losing staff due to vaccine mandates would have on providing ongoing services. British Columbia has put 3,225 health workers on unpaid leave for not being vaccinated. That only works out to roughly 2.5% of the health-care workforce in that province, but it still caused surgeries, diagnostics, and other medical procedures to be scaled back. Quebec was supposed to bring in a vaccine mandate for health workers on Oct. 15 but pushed it back to Nov. 15 in the face of more than 20,000 unvaccinated workers. When announcing the decision to delay the mandate, Quebec's health minister said losing those workers would have meant closing 35 operating rooms and 600 hospital beds. On Wednesday, Quebec dropped their vaccine mandate for existing health workers and said it would now only apply to new hires. Health Minister Christian Dube said Quebec couldn't afford to lose so many staff. ""To deprive ourselves of 8,000 people will have devastating consequences for our network,"" Dube said. Given Ontario's backlog of surgeries and the number of people who missed cancer screenings and other important medical procedures due to COVID shutdowns, it makes no sense to close operating rooms and cancel procedures over vaccination status. We need people to get treatment, not fire workers. Yet, that is what the opposition wants. I asked NDP Leader Andrea Horwath three times earlier this week what the balance should be between getting workers vaccinated and ensuring procedures aren't cancelled due to a lack of health workers. Three times, Horwath said she wanted a vaccine mandate - even if that meant cancelling surgeries. It would be preferable for everyone to be vaccinated, but that is not realistic. Nor is this the fault of Ford or the Ontario government and their policies. We don't get full vaccination when it comes to schools, the flu shot - even in the case of health workers - and this is not a problem unique to Ontario. Nor is this unique to health. Flights are being cancelled across North America as airlines fire or suspend unvaccinated workers. The TTC is curtailing bus service to deal with unvaccinated workers. The vast majority of people in Ontario, and across Canada, have been vaccinated and polls show strong support for vaccine mandates. Actions can have consequences, though, and one of the consequences of pushing a vaccine mandate will be fewer health workers. We've already seen workers shown the door or suspended, including 59 in Kingston, 57 in Windsor, 47 at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, 147 at Sick Kids, and nearly 200 at University Health Network in Toronto. Fewer workers mean less care; it's as simple as that. Ford has made a difficult decision, but it's the right one for ensuring patients aren't turned away due to a lack of staff.

LILLEY: Mandatory vaccinations for hospital workers not so easy,https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/lilley-mandatory-vaccinations-for-hospital-workers-not-be-so-easy,torontosun.com,The world is a simple place for Ontario’s Opposition: make vaccines mandatory and fire all the health workers who won’t get the shot.,['Brian Lilley'],2021-10-26 00:00:00,"Photo by The Canadian Press / Toronto Sun The world is a simple place for Ontario's Opposition: Make vaccines mandatory and fire all the health workers who won't get the shot. Forget the fact that a court just granted an emergency injunction to health workers in Toronto who were terminated last week, and that the concern is getting ahead of the surgery backlog rather than creating a new one. The NDP wants vaccine mandates and wants them now. ""Will the premier listen to his own experts and bring in mandatory vaccines for front-line workers and education workers?"" asked NDP MPP Sandy Shaw. Shaw cited the Ontario Science Table's call for mandatory vaccinations and their claim that burned-out health workers will face even more fatigue if unvaccinated workers can't work due to a COVID infection. Over the past several weeks, 57 hospital workers were fired in Windsor, 59 in Kingston, 200 at University Health Network in Toronto, and 147 were placed on unpaid leave at Sick Kids. Last Friday, Justice Sean Dunphy of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice issued an interim injunction in the case of several terminated UHN employees. ""The harm raised by the applicants is potentially serious and cannot be undone,"" Dunphy wrote. The applicants argue they cannot be vaccinated and left destitute by this decision. The case will be heard later this week and could have an impact on mandatory vaccination policies across the province. Why wait for that, though, bring in the mandatory vaccination policy now, chant the NDP! Premier Doug Ford said that he reached out to the people who run Ontario's hospital system and asked them what they wanted to see when it comes to mandatory policies. He also asked them specific questions about the situation in their areas. ""What is their plan to catch up on the backlog surgeries? What are their plans for the diagnostics? What are their plans to catch up on the cancer surgeries? That's what we need to know before we determine that,"" Ford said in the legislature. He also said that he had not heard back from hospital CEOs in Timmins, Thunder Bay, Sudbury, and some rural areas. Those are the specific areas that the government has said could face staffing shortages - and cancelled surgeries and diagnostics - if workers are terminated for not being vaccinated. ""We have received some responses, we are still receiving others, in order to be able to make a proper decision based on the clinical evidence and based on the knowledge that we have out there,"" Health Minister Christine Elliott said. Imagine that, getting evidence before making decisions. The NDP wants this to happen now, and the Liberals put forward a bill that would make vaccinations mandatory with the caveat no one would lose their job for failing to comply. The Liberals want to sound tough on the issue while offering no consequences, and the NDP want to see people fired regardless of the consequences. I encourage everyone to be vaccinated, and agree it would be best if everyone working in health care had both shots. That is not reality, though, and the government has to deal with the situation before them. More On This Topic Ontario court issues interim injunction against UHN vaccine mandate Ontario continues to mull mandatory vaccination for healthcare workers BRAUN: Public rally against Bill 124 underscores nurses' dissatisfaction If firing workers who are not vaccinated results in cancelled surgeries or cancer screenings, who does that help? Quebec has had to push back its mandate by a month or face the closure of operating rooms and beds. British Columbia had to soften their mandate to ensure continued care in seniors' homes. Too much of what has passed for policy during the pandemic has been posturing at best. The Ford government is asking the right questions - let's wait for the answers before making decisions. blilley@postmedia.com Your Midday Sun From our newsroom to your inbox at noon, the latest headlines, stories, opinion and photos from the Toronto Sun.

"John Robson: Another COVID lockdown would be devastating, but we all know it is coming",https://nationalpost.com/opinion/john-robson-another-covid-lockdown-would-be-devastating-but-we-all-know-it-is-coming,nationalpost.com,Governments must clearly explain how any new restrictions will help those most vulnerable,['John Robson'],2021-07-21 00:00:00,"Photo by Gavin Young/Postmedia Thank goodness the COVID lockdowns are over. Now we can get back to normal life which, unfortunately, increasingly means ending one lockdown and launching another. Enthusiasm is already building among the usual suspects. So to prevent mass death and promote human flourishing, can we take this moment of relative calm to outline a systematic approach? To recap briefly, my position for longer than I care to recall has been that when this dang thing first appeared, a drastic response was called for. We didn't know how contagious or virulent it was (h/t Matt Ridley for reminding us that virulent means ""harmful""), and if it spread like a cold and killed like Ebola there was no time to lose. But it doesn't. We did lose time. But our initial combination of panic with lethargy is spilled milk. Unlike the fact that we still don't know how contagious it is because we still have no idea how many people have caught it and were asymptomatic. Seriously. But we do have some idea to whom it is dangerous and it's not Jane Q. Public. So let's start our systematic approach there. Before launching another lockdown because of a rise in the variants, or because ending any lockdown seems invariably to produce a surge, can we please get a clear statement from the experts who say about who's statistically at risk from a severe case? And then, and I want to make this point absolutely clear, an explanation of how any new lockdown measures aim to prioritize protecting them. By now we must have sufficient data for polite coherence to replace yelling about getting with whatever the program is today. As on another point on which I have hammered until my arm hurts and your ears too: a clear statement of the expected costs of the lockdown. More On This Topic John Robson: A year of COVID cluelessness from our esteemed health 'experts' Rupa Subramanya: Why won't Trudeau let Canadians return to a life of normalcy? I'm no fan of econometrics. But before anyone says some dumb thing about valuing people over money, of course we must allocate scarce resources among competing ends in health care as elsewhere using some benchmark. In this case the QALY (to quote Wikipedia, ""The quality-adjusted life year … a generic measure of disease burden … is used in economic evaluation to assess the value of medical interventions. One QALY equates to one year in perfect health."") Moreover, we have extensive pre-COVID studies of the health costs of poverty, isolation, depression etc. Dismissive remarks about patio dining overlook that people's lives matter. Not just their existence. What they do while existing. Even ones you don't know or think much of. A massive disruption in family gatherings, religious attendance, education, exercise, social activities, or earning a living, isn't a joke. It burns QALYs as if they were trash. Here I'm indebted to True North for a Statistics Cananda report ""Provisional death counts and excess mortality"" that says some 5,535 Canadians under 65 died that would not have if there were no pandemic. COVID deaths for this group were 1,380, meaning ""indirect consequences"" of the pandemic were deadlier than the virus. The report warns, ""the pandemic could also have indirect consequences leading to an increase or decrease in the number of deaths due to various factors, including delayed medical procedures, increased substance use, or a decline in deaths attributable to other causes, such as influenza."" These things are not easy to count. But they do count, and someone should try, especially given our faith in computer models with hockey-stick case curves that fail laughably in practice. If you can count how many Canadians will die of COVID in three months if we wander about irresponsibly without T-shirts over our faces, you can count how many died unexpectedly during the lockdowns. Speaking of T-shirts, here's another thing that needs proper airing. Since spring 2020 we've been told nothing works but masks and vaccines. Now that we're getting serious vaccination rates we're being told vaccines don't work either (e.g NBC's July 19 ""All children should wear masks in school this fall, even if vaccinated, according to pediatrics group""), a strange role reversal that does raise suspicions about enthusiasm for a docile, properly managed populace in some quarters. So let's get serious about the real health risks in a population with vaccination-driven (or natural) ""herd immunity."" And can we finally talk about other remedies? Yes, I too sighed when the zinc-plus-vitamin-C zealots piped up. But there's enough evidence that acute cases correlate with vitamin D deficiency to merit further investigation and polite discussion. And on other topics including, finally, whether non-medical masks are anything but jujus. I never liked the lockdowns and fear their return. But I'm willing to be persuaded, if you've got good manners and sensible arguments about who's vulnerable and how best to protect them, the efficacy of various remedies and prophylaxes, and benefits and costs generally. What better time than now for calm, open debate? The big issues are far from settled. Sign up for the NP Comment newsletter, NP Platformed.

Rex Murphy: More reasons some Canadians distrust the powers-that-be,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/rex-murphy-more-reasons-some-canadians-distrust-the-powers-that-be,nationalpost.com,"Contradictory COVID advice, erroneous projections and delays in doing the obviously right things have left many doubting officials' wisdom",['Rex Murphy'],2021-09-30 00:00:00,"Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post I ended my last column on COVID contradictions from our political and medical authorities with a reference to last summer's Black Lives Matter protests, one of which was ornamented by an appearance (mask on, knee bent) by our own prime minister. These protests were declared medically welcome, if not necessary, in a time of COVID. That opinion was trumpeted in a major media statement by 1,200 ""medical authorities."" This was during the same period when eight or nine people clustered at a park picnic table to munch on chicken wings was understood as likely to spark the advent of Black Death 2.0. It must also be pointed out that those who set the rules were not serving as the best examples for those following the rules. As usual, that unshielded fellow we refer to as ""the little guy"" got whomped if he fell afoul of the protocols, whereas the protected class - politicians and movie stars - could romp unmasked with abandon. Grosser still, were the examples set by premiers - B.C.'s John Horgan for example - who pulled fast elections because they saw the timing as propitious. Another woeful example, alas, came from my home province, dear Newfoundland and Labrador. More woeful because the premier himself is a doctor, and yet did two things which offended common sense and medical prudence. Those who set the rules were not serving as the best examples He called an election during an unresolved COVID-19 pandemic. AND. He called an election, in February, in Newfoundland. For the latter alone he should have been tied to a fish flake and hissed at very severely for a few minutes, and gently pelted with over-fried cod tongues. On the other matter, outraging the COVID protocols for the sake of seeking political advantage, I recommend no punishment but that which arises from a potentially active conscience. Not incidentally, in the present month of September 2021, once-under-the bubble Newfoundland is having what passes for a ""spike"" in the home province, and like certain other regimes is about to bring in a ""vaccine passport."" I wonder, as a kind of footnote, whether ""passport,"" as it is being deployed in this instance, means a Newfoundlander on the northeast coast who wishes to wander from Twillingate, say, to visit his sick mother in Bonavista, has to provide ID, his health card and a government-issued COVID passport? As he approaches the outskirts of that historic settlement, will he be confronted by town border guards? Will there be a shout of ""Halt! Who goes there? Vax or unVax? Spell Pfizer"" before he can pass? More On This Topic Rex Murphy: How COVID-19 taught the public to distrust the authorities Rex Murphy: You want to eat that doughnut here? Show me your papers Smirk at the thought if you will, but COVID has this wondrous ability to give governments and even town councils a jolt of unbounded authority and high-handedness only dreamed of in certain eastern countries some decades past. I'm running through the whole COVID era to ground some observations which will come in the next and final instalment, about mandated vaccinations and vaccination passports. It's a context needed before any comment on the latest and most stringent Charter-of-Rights-insulting decrees from some provincial governments. I also judge a sketch of all governments' spotty responses is especially necessary, now, in responding to Justin Trudeau's increasingly nasty cracks and dismissive references to the 15 per cent of Canadians who are resistant. Our inclusive PM piles them together in a one-dimensional heap under the ugly and reductive term ""anti-vaxxers."" Our inclusive PM piles them together in a one-dimensional heap Occasionally within the murky sludge of Twitter postings there is a small pearl of clarity to be found, and this one fits that rare bill. This from a person not, so far, agreeable to the new mandates: ""I am not a ‘conspiracy theorist', an ‘anti-vaxxer', an ‘anti-masker', a ‘white supremacist' or whatever other labels they/you want to throw at me. I am an independent, critical-thinker that has valid questions and concerns after the suspension of our liberties for 15 months."" Worth a PM's pondering, that. What I have offered in this and my preceding column is a most abridged account of the time since COVID-19 first threatened. And as such it presents only an abbreviated sample of the false starts, reversals, contradictions, muddled and erroneous projections, delays in doing the obviously right things, discrepancies and hypocrisies in official behaviours (I travel on private jet; you don't), special treatment for various classes (see NBA players today), unequal impact depending on type of employment (small stores closed, big chains open), near-criminal mismanagement of long-term care homes where COVID was identifiably rampant, delays in treatments for illnesses other than COVID due to the crippling diminishment of normal medical services, from family doctors to so-called ""elective"" surgeries (ask someone who's waiting for a surgery whether she thinks it's a choice, i.e. elective), and the sealing off of gravely ill persons from all or almost all of their nearest loved ones. As said, this is but an abridged account of the many factors that have weakened trust, attenuated patience, stirred resistance, and greatly amplified the public's questioning of the decrees, mandates and guidance that has issued, confusedly, from our various governments. For the very few who have followed this sequence I shall wrap it up in the next column, on mandated vaccines. National Post The big issues are far from settled.

Raymond J. de Souza: A compelling critique of Ontario's vaccine mandates,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/raymond-j-de-souza-a-compelling-critique-of-ontarios-vaccine-mandates,nationalpost.com,"The province’s circumstances 'do not justify the coercive and disruptive policies' that have been implemented, Cardus think-tank tells Premier Ford",['Father Raymond J. De Souza'],2021-10-16 00:00:00,"Photo by Chris Young/The Canadian Press Vaccine mandates and associated ""passports"" can be justified only as effective prophylaxis in a genuine public health emergency, but not as a punitive policy intended to coerce compliance. In that position I have the official support of the premier of Canada's largest province, Doug Ford, who has said repeatedly that vaccine mandates will not last ""one day more than necessary."" I take Ford to mean ""necessary"" in its usual meaning. His chief public health officer, Kieran Moore, seems to think it means something else, stating that the mandates - with the exclusion of the unvaccinated from increasing swaths of common life, including employment - could last well into 2022 . There are now some Ontario hospitals that have announced a ban on unvaccinated visitors. Not hospitals with overflowing ICUs, with other patients stacked up in the corridors. Hospitals that have few, if any, COVID patients at all. Hospitals that have on site the capacity for rapid testing. Nonetheless, patients in hospital, including the gravely ill, will be banned from having unvaccinated visitors, even if the patient is vaccinated and the visitor could easily be tested upon arrival. Some Ontario hospitals have announced a ban on unvaccinated visitors Pandemic policy is a matter of balance. In Ontario, that balance has been elusive. Schools were closed for months on end, with all the attendant negative consequences for students, in health regions where there were fewer active cases than children in a typical classroom. Measures introduced to deal with rising case counts at a certain level were continued even under falling case counts at half or a quarter of that level. Now my colleagues at Cardus, in the form of an open letter to Premier Ford , have provided a detailed analysis of the vaccine passport policy, with concrete proposals for alternatives that are effective, practical and not punitive. ""We've Got Better Options"" is not government-hating, conspiracy-spotting, anti-scientific raving. It is sober analysis. The letter's message to the premier is blunt: ""Ontario is not in an emergency, and this province's circumstances do not justify the coercive and disruptive vaccine policies that your government has imposed."" More On This Topic Raymond J. de Souza: Justin Trudeau's 'punitive' vaccine mandate Chris Selley: Trudeau's new vaccine mandates are a chance for anti-vaxxers to switch tactics Read the open letter. Disagree it with its policy alternatives to mandates and passports if you like. But pay attention to the data. Much of what you think you know, or have been told, you don't actually know. Ontario's pandemic policy has been largely driven by predictions by the Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table. It sketches out various scenarios, including a harrowing worst-case one, and then the government responds. This is how it works. Ford rejected the idea of vaccine passports in July. When he reversed himself six weeks later, the situation had not deteriorated. What happened? Enter the Science Table. ""Despite a vague but alarming forecast by the Ontario COVID Science Advisory Table - released the same day as your passport announcement - the ‘fourth wave' has been underwhelming,"" Cardus writes to Ford. ""Even with the reopening of schools in September, daily cases have not reached 1,000, while ICU occupancy has not risen even to the Science Table's best-case projection."" Ontario is not in an emergency Open letter to Premier Doug Ford from Cardus As for Ford's reversal, Cardus writes: ""ICU occupancy [due to Covid] is actually lower than it was at the time of your ‘hard no' to passports, at 17 per cent of the third-wave peak. COVID-involved patients occupy less than one per cent of Ontario's 33,000 hospital beds. The Table's updated forecast (Sept. 28) describes a much less grim scenario than the previous model - and is already too pessimistic, as ICU occupancy is again below the stated best-case scenario."" Why are Ontario hospitals not filling up as the Science Table thought possible? Perhaps because, despite the fretting about the unvaccinated, Ontario is effectively a fully vaccinated province. Yes, I know the global figures. But consider this: ""In Ontario, almost 98 per cent of those above the age of 80, and 96 per cent of those over 70, have had at least one dose; this number falls to 79.1 per cent in the 18-29 age group. Thus vaccination rates are already proportionate to the threat, and a coercive vaccination policy has the greatest effect on those who are statistically at least risk. Those who are at greatest risk gain little in the way of risk reduction, as they are already highly protected by the vaccines themselves."" With those world-leading rates of vaccination, widespread access to rapid testing would largely obviate the need for vaccine mandates. COVID-19 is a serious, even lethal, threat to some of the elderly. Yet their vaccination rate is over 95 per cent, far exceeding any target set by any health authority anywhere on the planet. For the least vulnerable adults, the twentysomethings, the rate is about 80 per cent, very high too. While there are important regional differences across the country that require a different policy balance, the burden of the argument in Canada must be on those who wish to ramp up mandates, even while we have, along with Spain, the highest vaccination rate of any large country (population over 30 million). The Cardus open letter has raised the bar that argument must meet. National Post The big issues are far from settled. Sign up for the NP Comment newsletter, NP Platformed.

Our lives have been turned upside down, our sense of security has been threatened, and our patience has been sorely tested. But Albertans have stepped up, as we always do. We have worked to follow the guidelines of Alberta Health, and get vaccinated at a remarkable pace. Now, we're in a place where that period will hopefully soon be behind us, and we can embrace the life we all want to live again. As we enter summer, we are all excited to return to the familiar and fun of community gatherings and celebrations. We see airports opening and tourists on the move. We see businesses reopening and restaurants bustling. But, although our economy needs as much stimulus as possible, people may still be anxious. And that is totally legitimate. Our community wants to move ahead, but they want to do it with prudence and responsibility. At the Calgary Stampede, we understand that sentiment. We respect that sentiment. We have planned our annual celebration around that sentiment. Opinion: Calgary Stampede will lead the way in the safe reopening of events Over the last couple of weeks, the Calgary Stampede has done a lot to tell our story. We did that because people deserve proof that we will be acting responsibly. We also did it because there has been some misinformation circulating, and you deserve to make decisions based on the facts. To that end, we have been laser-focused on getting into the community with an honest conversation about our safety protocols. These measures are designed to exceed public health guidelines and to allow our valued guests to Stampede their own way in 2021. Yes, the Stampede will lead the way in the safe return to live events in Canada. Know we don't take that responsibility lightly. Stampede 2021 will look a bit different. For example, we will be limiting gate entry to allow for greater space. We will be providing people with seating options to provide a greater sense of comfort. Our front-line volunteers and employees will wear masks, and our guests will be respected and encouraged to make the masking choice they are comfortable with. Perhaps the most significant sign of the Stampede as a trailblazer in the safe return to live events is Nashville North. As live music returns in a unique canopy-style tent, venue patrons will be asked to provide proof of vaccination or take a rapid test before entry. These safety measures, and others, exceed what has been asked of us by Alberta Health and other authorities. That's because we want to do everything we can to operate safely and to send a clear signal that the well-being of our guests, our partners and our people drives our decision-making. While we appreciate the confidence invested in us by each order of government, we will not rest until we have the confidence of you - our community. Stampede is an internationally acclaimed event with a rightfully proud history. We got here because of public support, and we will do everything we can to retain that support. Despite our enduring success, the Calgary Stampede has been knocked down in the past - including two world wars and a devastating flood - but each time we have faced adversity we have gotten back up, dusted ourselves off, and put on The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth! We will do the same in 2021. Yes, some of Stampede will look different this year. Let's accept that the last year and a half has asked everyone to reconsider how they do what they do. This also applies to the Stampede. Our focus is to bring you the best experience in the most responsible way possible. We hope that your decisions will be made on the facts and that you will join us for some Stampede fun this summer. Dana Peers is the interim CEO of the Calgary Stampede.

Opinion: How the coronavirus will change travel,https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-how-the-coronavirus-will-change-travel,leaderpost.com,"While it is true that people often display an incredible ability to forget, some of the changes in the travel industry are probably here to stay.",['Dean Johnston'],2020-04-23 00:00:00,"Photo by TROY FLEECE / Regina Leader-Post A lot has changed in our lives over the past few months and, unfortunately, not all of it is going back to normal when the spread of COVID-19 eventually slows down. And, while it is true that people often display an incredible (some might say irrational) ability to forget, some of the changes in the travel industry are probably here to stay. 1. Domestic travel is back . Most international flights have been grounded, governments are turning foreigners away and everyone is (or at least should be) concerned that wherever they go, they could end up stranded there indefinitely. So, while right now we're not supposed to be going any farther than the end of the driveway, that will eventually change and people are going to be wanting a vacation more substantial than taking the dog to the park before eating an entire package of Oreos on the couch. Luckily for us, Canada is a huge and diverse country with endless recreational options. Expect a lot more people to steer clear of complicated international travel and instead explore their own country this year, particularly focusing on wide open spaces - hiking, camping, boating - that they can reach by car. 2. All-inclusive beach resorts will undergo a serious overhaul . Social interaction and physical mingling are practically mantras of the hedonistic all-inclusive holidays Canadians love so much. While this season is obviously finished, these resorts should be open for business again by next winter and there are probably going to be some very good deals to be had. But the key is going to be convincing potential guests of impeccable standards of hygiene. Buffet servers, industrious teams of workers constantly disinfecting all common areas and hand sanitizer dispensers everywhere are just a few of the innovations you can expect. Photo by ELIZABETH RUIZ / AFP via Getty Images 3. Being a snowbird just got a lot more complicated . As if border restrictions, isolation recommendations, age risk, and health insurance exclusions weren't going to be troublesome enough, the reckless behaviour of some returning snowbirds this year is going to reflect badly on the group as a whole. While most snowbirds returned to Canada in a timely and careful manner, the irresponsible few that ignored precautions, potentially spread the virus from town to town all the way through the U.S and then refused to isolate upon arriving home is going to mean added scrutiny and suspicion next winter. 4. Focus on safety and hygiene . Travellers are going to be far more selective about their destinations. Instead of just watching out for armed conflicts and recent natural disasters, now people will be scouring all the latest COVID-19 statistics and travel restrictions before booking that next trip. Then, once they hit the road, it is going to be all about disinfecting, obsessive hand washing, and avoiding hotspots like water fountain buttons and busy door handles. We're already learning just how much we can accomplish using our elbows. 5. Changing attitudes . On the one hand, travellers should probably expect a less enthusiastic welcome in most parts of the world. If this whole fiasco has taught us one thing that we've been teaching our kids for years, it's ""stranger danger."" One benefit, however, is that when (not if) we are allowed to travel freely once again, we are going to appreciate it on a whole new level. For at least a year or two, then we'll go back to complaining about having to take our shoes off in security and resume shaking our heads at the people who stand up as soon as the plane stops. It'll be fun while it lasts, though. Of course, the list goes on. A lot of people will return to using a travel agent to book their trips. The cruise ship industry is in for a major overhaul: Fewer cruises, fewer passengers, more stringent hygiene standards and, potentially, big discounts. The next year or two might be the perfect time to see the world's most popular tourist attractions without the usual crowds. When possible, people are going to save up for one longer trip instead of taking several short trips. There are sure to be some surprisingly cheap hotels, tours and package deals available. Free cancellation and date changes are going to become standard when booking flights and hotels. Expect a serious increase in airport security and safety measures, including requiring proof that you have already had COVID-19 or on-site testing for those who haven't. Don't worry, travel isn't dead. There have been countless disasters over the years that have impacted people's desire and ability to travel and the industry always bounces back. Just don't expect it to look the same as when you left it.

OPINION: Mandatory vaccination for COVID has no rational basis,https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-no-covid-19-vaccine-passports-and-mandatory-vaccination-do-not-protect-the-health-and-safety-of-canadians,torontosun.com,"Public health officers and political decision-makers continue to misrepresent the limited scientific knowledge about the vaccines, a group of academics write","['Claus Rinner', 'Laurent Leduc', 'Jan Vrbik', 'Angela Durante', 'Valentina Capurri', 'Donald G. Welsh', 'Jean-Marc Benoit', 'Maximilian C. Forte', 'Special To Toronto Sun']",2021-08-24 00:00:00,"OPINION: No, COVID-19 vaccine passports and mandatory vaccination do not 'protect the health and safety of Canadians' OPINION: No, COVID-19 vaccine passports and mandatory vaccination do not 'protect the health and safety of Canadians' Photo by Paul Chiasson / THE CANADIAN PRESS New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh was quoted last week with the suggestion that public servants who refuse the COVID-19 vaccine could be disciplined and ultimately fired using existing collective agreement clauses. The leader of Canada's most labour-friendly party recommends these worker dismissals in order to ""protect the health and safety of Canadians."" This logic is so blatantly flawed that it calls Singh's leadership, and that of other Canadian politicians supporting this view, into question. OPINION: No, COVID-19 vaccine passports and mandatory vaccination do not 'protect the health and safety of Canadians' The trials conducted by the vaccine manufacturers have only recorded whether vaccinated people were less likely to get symptomatic COVID than the unvaccinated. The trials did not check for a reduction in ""cases"" as measured by positive SARS-CoV-2 tests without symptoms, nor in COVID-19 hospitalizations or deaths. They also did not attempt to understand the impact of the vaccines on transmission. The interim authorization of the vaccines was based on their efficacy in reducing what amounts to cold symptoms in the vaccinated person. Since the start of the mass vaccinations, researchers worldwide have examined whether vaccination does reduce the spread of COVID as a positive side effect. While it seems plausible that such an effect might occur, the results are meagre. Some studies found modest reductions in the spread of the original SARS-CoV-2 variant, a far cry from ""stopping"" transmission. With the Delta variant, the effect has further shrunk and in a CDC-funded study, vaccinated individuals carried similar viral loads as the unvaccinated. Countries like Israel and Iceland that have achieved high vaccination rates in the population are currently seeing their ""case"" counts rise dramatically. In the last two weeks, Israel's COVID-19 death count is now also following this concerning trajectory. Meanwhile, the province of Ontario with over 70% twice-vaccinated people is preparing for a fourth wave and already has significantly more cases, hospitalizations and deaths than one year ago, when nobody was vaccinated. So, what is a vaccine passport supposed to prove? What are vaccination mandates meant to achieve? Before Delta, vaccinated individuals may have been slightly less contagious than the unvaccinated. But with Delta, there does not appear to be a difference in spreading the virus. If anything, the vaccine works to protect the recipient. It is therefore nobody's business to know whether another person is vaccinated or not. And there is no reason to expect, pressure or require another person to ""take the jab."" The campaign to vaccinate children and young adults is particularly offensive, since they bear all the risks from short- and long-term adverse events and obtain no measurable benefits from the shot. In addition, people who had recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection were not recruited for the pharma companies' phase II/III trials. Therefore, we also do not know how the vaccines interact with natural immunity from a previous infection. Having recovered from COVID-19 should count for something. It appears that the Progressive Conservative caucus in the Ontario legislature grants its members an exemption if getting vaccinated is ""unnecessary … by reason of past infection or laboratory evidence of immunity."" This could indicate a first step in returning to a common-sense approach to managing the virus. Germany is one example of a country where three groups - recovered, negatively tested and fully vaccinated individuals - are treated the same way, at least in some areas of public life. Mandatory vaccination for COVID has no rational basis. We must wonder what the true motivations are when public health doctors, union leaders and politicians insist on vaccine passports. It is high time that we wake up from our collective delusion and return to some form of normal life. That includes preventing and treating respiratory diseases, as we always have, without intruding in personal health decisions. - Claus Rinner, PhD, Geography, Geographic Information Science; Laurent Leduc, PhD, Theology, Ethics, and Interdisciplinary Studies; Jan Vrbik, PhD, Statistics; Angela Durante, PhD, History; Valentina Capurri, PhD, History, Geography; Donald G.

LILLEY: Hold off on new restrictions to control Omicron,https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/lilley-hold-off-on-new-restrictions-to-control-omicron,torontosun.com,The discussion around COVID on Tuesday at Queen's Park was starting to feel like I was watching a bad movie for the second time.,['Brian Lilley'],2021-12-07 00:00:00,"Photo by Reuters / Toronto Sun The discussion around COVID on Tuesday at Queen's Park was starting to feel like I was watching a bad movie for the second time. Why wasn't the government acting now to stop Omicron, the opposition and media demanded to know. The answer from government officials was, of course, that they wanted more information, more data. The reaction from those demanding action could be summed up as, why wait for data when you can act without the facts? I get it, there are times to act quickly - such as with border screening when a new variant appears - but forcing Ontarians to endure new restrictions or an extension of restrictions in the absence of clear data is foolish. This province, more than any other, has moved slowly at reopening and kept measures in place - such as masking - far longer than anywhere else in the country. Still, the call was clear: the government should announce today that it will not consider lifting requirements for vaccine certificates or passports on Jan. 17, six weeks from now. ""Why don't you just say, ‘In light of the new information, we are going to extend the certificates,' and give small business some certainty?"" New Democrat John Vanthof asked at the top of question period. The answer from the government was simple: It needed more data, especially about the new Omicron variant. ""It's only reasonable to expect that we need to wait to obtain that information from South Africa and from scientists around the world,"" Health Minister Christine Elliott said. Sounds reasonable to me, but not to others, it seems. Later in the day, Dr. Kieran Moore, the province's chief medical officer, was asked repeatedly why he wasn't saying the government would extend vaccine passports even though that decision doesn't need to be made for nearly six weeks. Moore said he wants to see the data after the start of the new year before making a decision. That was a statement that seemed to fluxom some who couldn't understand why he wouldn't make a decision today for mid-January. ""I just want to assure Ontarians that they have been responsive to the data and if there is a risk to Ontarians, this process will be maintained,"" Moore said, regarding the vaccine passport/certificate system and what the government might do. That's always been the position of the Ford government. If things are going well, they will start reducing restrictions, starting with the vax passport. If the situation isn't conducive to relaxing restrictions, they will stay in place. Some want more restrictions and they want them now! Moore was pressed on why he wasn't imposing measures that would legally force people to reduce their social contacts. It's as if some people don't realize that we aren't in the same position as we were in March 2020. Ontario currently has a 99.9% vaccination rate for those over the age of 80, still the most vulnerable group. The vaccination rate for anyone over the age of 40 never falls below 86%. It's true that we don't know the impact of Omicron; it appears to be more transmissible, but the virulence is up for debate at this point. We saw last week - through a Canadian Medical Association study - that heading back into a lockdown that would limit access to health care would not only be detrimental to health outcomes but deadly. More On This Topic Omicron variant won't stop Toronto's reopening plans: Tory Omicron's impact on Ontario reopening not immediately clear: Elliott We knew cases would rise come the fall and winter, even Ontario's self-appointed and often-wrong Science Table said that would be the case. In their latest projections, just three weeks after their last, they admit that public health measures are working. As Premier Ford said last week, Omicron is ""cause for concern, but it's not cause for panic."" More people would be wise to heed those words.

LILLEY: Rapid tests the latest political fetish in public health crisis,https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/lilley-rapid-tests-the-latest-political-fetish-in-public-health-crisis,torontosun.com,Rapid tests are the latest fad that will solve this pandemic and get Ontario back to normal once and for all.,['Brian Lilley'],2021-12-08 00:00:00,"Photo by CHRIS YOUNG / THE CANADIAN PRESS I'm not sure if you've noticed, but every few weeks or months, there's a new silver bullet that, if only Doug Ford would act on, would end the pandemic. A little while ago it was rapid testing, then it was vaccine passports, and now it's rapid tests. ""Why hasn't the premier rolled out free, widely available rapid tests for Ontarians like other provinces and other jurisdictions worldwide have done?"" NDP Leader Andrea Horwath asked during question period. It's a line repeated often at Queen's Park. In fact, it has become a standard talking point that the Ford government is sitting on these tests that are widely available everywhere else. It's true that in the United States you can walk into your local CVS or Walgreens and buy a test to do at home for just $10, but that isn't the case here. In Canada, you can't walk into Shoppers or Rexall and buy a take-home test. These tests aren't approved for wide distribution by Health Canada and the use of rapid tests in this country is controlled by the government. The feds ship rapid tests to provinces, which distribute them - that is how our system works. So far, the federal government has sent 31 million rapid tests to Ontario and the province has deployed or allocated 34 million tests - meaning they've purchased more on their own. Those tests are used in long-term care homes, hospitals, workplaces, and congregant living centres. The province says their distribution and use of rapid tests amounts to about 1 million per week. That's above and beyond the 11 million rapid tests the province purchased to be sent home with school children ahead of the Christmas break. Each student will get a pack of five tests to be used over the holidays. How all of this amounts to claims that Doug Ford is personally stopping them from being used or that he's hoarding them and letting them collect dust in a warehouse is beyond me. ""We're doing 57% of all rapid testing in the entire country,"" Ford said Wednesday. ""We're handing it out in transit areas, we're handing it out to businesses, we're handing out the congregate care, home care, long-term care, hospitals."" Horwath called for rapid tests to be handed out at Santa Claus parades similar to what has been done in Nova Scotia. The NDP leader should be careful in her comparisons because Nova Scotia has only distributed 32% of the 4 million tests it has received from the federal government. Handing them out at parades might be their attempt to boost that. Alexandra Hilkene, press secretary to Health Minister Christine Elliott, said the province does have a plan that includes the Christmas school kits, testing when needed in schools, workplace testing, and a new feature about to be launched. ""Over the coming weeks, the province will also be bringing asymptomatic rapid testing directly to Ontarians with pop-up testing sites in high-traffic public settings, such as malls, retail settings, holiday markets, and transit hubs,"" Hilkene said. Short of grabbing people on the street and forcing a rapid test on them, I'm not sure what more the province can do here. Would it be good if these tests were easier to get? Sure, but that won't mean an end to the pandemic. Rapid tests are a screening tool, that is all. This recent frenzy over them, as if they are the solution we've been lacking, is misplaced, and it's being driven by political posturing rather than sound public health advice.

It's a phrase that's now been uttered by a number of public health officials across Canada. It's even made its way into formal government documents. Learning to live with COVID-19 means different things to different people, and there are a variety of ways to go about it. At its most basic, it means acknowledging what some infectious diseases experts have been saying for some time now - that this virus is becoming endemic. This means that it is not something that's going to disappear anytime soon or, perhaps, even this century. The good news is that due to treatments, vaccines and acquired immunity the severity of the virus lessens and recedes into the background. Learning to live with COVID-19 doesn't mean failing to protect the vulnerable and it doesn't mean that we stop taking COVID-19 seriously. But it does mean that we wind down our COVID-19 protocols. There have been a variety of serious reports and warnings about the harms that have been caused to society - particularly our youth - by measures enacted to deal with the pandemic."

Bernier was excluded from the leaders' TV debates and his party was hammered with negative coverage during the campaign for its anti-mask stance and for attracting certain unsavoury characters (one since-removed party official threw gravel at Justin Trudeau) - yet it still managed to double the vote share of the Greens. Bernier joins Anthony to explain why he thinks his party is much more than a protest against repressive pandemic policies.

Rupa Subramanya: Message of COVID-19 doom from health officials out of touch with reality,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/rupa-subramanya-message-of-covid-19-doom-from-health-officials-out-of-touch-with-reality,nationalpost.com,COVID zero was never an attainable goal,['Rupa Subramanya'],2021-08-12 00:00:00,"Photo by Carlos Osorio/Pool/AFP via Getty Images When British Prime Minister Boris Johnson lifted most pandemic restrictions on July 19, which the British called ""Freedom Day,"" there were howls of protests from many epidemiologists and public health experts on both sides of the Atlantic. Doomsayers prophesied catastrophe as cases were already on the rise, driven by the potentially immune escaping and highly transmissible Delta variant. But almost a month in, COVID-19 cases are down from a peak of close to nearly 50,000 new cases on July 20 to less than 30,000 new cases per day. And this is well below the earlier peak of almost 60,000 new cases on January 9 in a previous wave. We've been told throughout the pandemic that what matters are hospital admissions, especially ICU admissions and mortality, and not just the infection rate. In the UK, hospital admissions have risen from a low point of about 100 admissions per day in mid May to around 700 per day now. While this sounds high, it's way below the peak of over 4,000 per day in January. There's a similar pattern in Israel, which reopened in May. While cases and hospital admissions have risen, they're well below previous peaks. On August 11, it was reported that health officials in Israel were predicting nearly 5,000 new hospitalizations in the coming weeks. This, along with the uptick in cases, has prompted officials in Israel to roll out booster vaccine doses for those above 60 and to increase hospital capacity. Importantly, there are no plans at present to re-enter lockdown. Health officials in the UK and Israel, and equally importantly the politicians who make decisions based on their inputs, have realized that herd immunity is a chimera. In an extraordinarily frank interview, Sir Andrew Pollard, head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, and a key voice in the UK's health policy space, said unequivocally that herd immunity is impossible , both because the delta variant can infect vaccinated individuals, and because neither UK or anyone else can prevent the emergence of new variants. Likewise, Tal Brosh, in the Israeli health ministry, has said that many people will end up becoming infected at some point or other, and what is really relevant is whether they're vaccinated or not as this will determine the severity of their symptoms. Both countries have realized that the goal of ""COVID zero"" is both unattainable and the wrong target to aim at. More On This Topic Chris Selley: Alberta's controversial COVID plan is bold, but that doesn't make it crazy Rupa Subramanya: Why won't Trudeau let Canadians return to a life of normalcy In Canada, and specifically in Ontario, the approach to further reopening is tied rigidly to specific immunization targets. For example, the government of Premier Doug Ford has made clear that the lifting of remaining restrictions will require that 80 per cent of those eligible have received one dose of the vaccine, 75 per cent of those eligible have received both doses, and at least 70 per cent of Ontarians are fully vaccinated in all of the province's 34 public health units. This is by far the most stringent standard anywhere in the advanced world. In fact, according to the Oxford COVID-19 Response Tracker, Canada has had the most stringent lockdowns and r estrictions of any advanced country with the exception of Australia, which has now been trapped in limbo with their COVID zero policy. While we're close to attaining these immunization targets, thus largely decoupling hospitalizations from infections, the recent increase in cases and fear of the Delta variant is feeding a narrative of panic and paranoia and the apparent jettisoning of everything we've been told to believe until now. Thus, for example, just last month, Peter Juni, the scientific director of Ontario's COVID-19 Science Advisory Table, said that COVID-19 would be impossible to eradicate and should be treated as ""more like influenza"" than the measles. Fast forward to August 11, and Juni is now saying ( in an interview with CP24 ) that he won't support any further easing of restrictions given the recent rise in cases. What changed in a month? Juni asserted that we are now already in a fourth wave, and went so far as to claim that if Ontario were to pursue an Alberta style approach lifting all restrictions, there could be as many as 20,000 ICU admissions in the next six to eight weeks. For context, according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, during the period January 2020 to February 2021, there were less than 8,000 ICU admissions in all of Canada except for Quebec - and this was before widespread vaccination. Juni doesn't tell us where he gets his extraordinary prediction from. While the caution of experts such as Juni is laudable, it runs the risk of feeding fear and paradoxically strengthening the hand of anti-vaxxers and hardening vaccine hesitancy. Someone could rightly ask, if vaccines actually work, how could we possibly end up in a catastrophic emergency with ICU beds stretched way beyond the limit? And what was the point? Given the platform they occupy and how seriously their every word is taken, experts need to stay on message: get fully vaccinated, and even if you get COVID-19, your symptoms will likely be mild. The media should do its part by not overhyping every day's new cases, and ignoring the decoupled hospitalize and mortality rates, and by breaking down new infections into those who're fully vaccinated as against those who are not. Ontario now publishes such data, and it makes clear that the vast majority of recent infections are among the unvaccinated or those partially vaccinated. This is an optimistic message, but unfortunately what we seem to hear from any of the talking heads is still a narrative of impending doom and disaster. This is doing the public and policy makers a great disservice. National Post The big issues are far from settled. Sign up for the NP Comment newsletter, NP Platformed.

A Georgetown, Ontario farmer (yours truly) has speculated that there may be a run on processed and sliced cheese products as concern over the Omicron variant intensifies. Many of the countries that first identified the Omicron variant are known to consume processed and/or sliced cheese. More ominous, airports that are the gateway of COVID variants commonly offer food services that include cheese slices. To date there is no confirmation that existing vaccines are effective against a cheese spread virus and little data on the long-term public health effects of cheese slices. Experts are, no doubt, researching any potential linkage and exploring the variants of concern (individually wrapped cheese slices vs bulk packaging). Public health measures in Canada have largely ignored the potential connection of sliced and/or processed cheese and viruses and there is, as of now, no scientific connection between cheese spread and virus spread. Experts have long pointed to airborne transmission as the primary method of community COVID spread. However, the Georgetown farmer pointed out that, notwithstanding science, extraordinary (read dumb, stupid, annoying) hygiene precautions continue to be mandated, apparently to slow transmission of COVID. Therefore, in light of the unknown infection rate of the Omicron variant, it is entirely logical to extend the precautionary principle to the, admittedly slight, possibility of cheese spread induced virus spread. Canada's public health officials should ban cheese spread and provide guidance on cheese slices immediately. At a minimum, cheese testing at all airports should be mandatory. Of course, I'm just kidding. That Georgetown farmer is highly unreliable (just ask Sharon). Banning processed cheese would be the culinary ruination of most of my friends. But the spoof on cheese has nothing on the tons of pure bovine nutrient recently floated over the Omicron variant. Never have so many experts opinioned with greater certainty and less knowledge than the steady stream of conjecture over what a new variant of concern means and how government should act. To be clear, this is fear-mongering at a massive level. The basic facts haven't changed since the novel coronavirus emerged in 2019. Viruses mutate constantly. The mutations that survive are more contagious. Eventually the efficacy of vaccines diminishes, and new vaccine variations must be deployed. What does all that mean? COVID is here to stay. We will require regular vaccinations to prevent rampant spread and serious health outcomes. COVID is endemic. It appears, ""temporary"" public health measures are also endemic, expanding with every new variant. Real people are now caught in the unreal world of panicked border closures, unclear testing requirements and proposed quasi-quarantines. And this, my friends, is all science based. We can do better. Heck, we can use better science. Apparently, Canada backed off regular screening for variants when the Delta strain became predominate. Did some genius figure the virus was done with the whole mutation thing? Partial border closures are ineffective against a virus, and we are unwilling (and possibly unable) to consider full closures. So, what exactly is the point of more, partial closures? Does anyone really believe that a virus is going to stop at the US border because we have made casual travel more cumbersome? We don't need more fear. We don't need to drive panic every time a new variant shows up. We need long-term public health measures that we can live with for the long haul. Or, heck, we could just ban processed cheese. Your Midday Sun From our newsroom to your inbox at noon, the latest headlines, stories, opinion and photos from the Toronto Sun.

Raymond J. de Souza: Lining up to show COVID travel documents is the road to serfdom,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/raymond-j-de-souza-lining-up-to-show-covid-travel-documents-is-the-road-to-serfdom,nationalpost.com,"Upon arrival in Canada, the government has deployed an army of its own officials to register passengers online and then to administer tests",['Father Raymond J. De Souza'],2021-07-25 00:00:00,"Photo by Frank Gunn / Canadian Press The federal government announced the opening of the border to fully-vaccinated Americans on August 9, while holding off on other countries until September 7, arguing that the intervening weeks will allow for protocols at the border to be streamlined. Good luck with that. Have federal officials observed what is actually going on at the border now? Canadians wishing to fly out of Canada need to show a negative COVID-19 test before embarking. Who checks that? The airlines. Who else could do it? The Canadian government does not have agents monitoring passengers leaving the country. That means that a check-in agent, whose previous training was in determining allowable baggage limits, now, with understandably no expertise or experience in the matter, has to evaluate whatever documents passengers produce. If you are in Toronto and you have a standard Ontario Health COVID test, that would be easy enough. But you are not supposed to have that standard Ontario Health result because the public health system is not supposed to do COVID tests for travel purposes. So the airline agent will likely be confronted with a document from a private lab, each one with its own format. On the other end, the customs and border official in, say, Lisbon, is supposed to monitor vaccination status. Is she familiar with documents issued by the health system in Nova Scotia, or an Indigenous reserve in British Columbia? What about a Walgreen's vaccine record from Colorado? So unless the passenger himself reveals a lack of vaccination, whatever document is produced is waved through. And if whatever document is waved through, why require it in the first place? On the return it is even more absurd. Canada requires a negative COVID test for entry, and is particular about which kind. PCR is is the favoured flavour, not antigen. That means another airline agent must determine - in English or French, no matter if his first language is Polish or German - whether the right result was obtained at the right time with the right kind of test. Numerous acquaintances confirm what one would expect: everyone is waved through. A friend had the recent experience of gate agents, while boarding hundreds of passengers, attempting to verify (for the second time) COVID test documents. In a process that is designed to work at the speed of scanning a barcode, it quickly degenerated in clogged chaos; thus as a piece of paper or mobile phone was waved in the general direction of the gate agent, everyone was good to go. I have no great trouble with this. Sometimes - like riding the streetcar or visiting a national park - the honour system is really the best way to proceed, with occasional spot checks to encourage compliance. The government having dragooned airline personnel into an impossible job, the honour system is what we have got anyway. . It moves admirably quickly, given what is being done, but still takes over an hour or more to get through a single flight. That's only with Canadians returning home at the moment; imagine the queues when Americans and others arrive. And this is to test the already-vaccinated, who are extremely unlikely to pose a health threat. All of this reveals what Friedrich Hayek taught us long ago. The 1974 winner of the Nobel Prize for economics, Hayek was among the foremost advocates of the free society. But Hayek's more relevant work now was on the simple impossibility of central planners knowing all the information necessary to plan for the millions of economic exchanges that take place daily. Observing the inability of the state to accurately determine even a fairly discrete set of data - test results and vaccination status - is oddly comforting, a confirmation that Hayek was correct. Confirmation should not be needed after the failed experiments in central planning of the past - or present, in Venezuela and Cuba. The only way for the government to implement a robust monitoring system for travel would be to deploy dozens of agents to every international airport and border, charged with adequately examining and verifying the documents needed. That would be expensive, and would mean hours-long waits in the terminal or at the border. Queuing to be subject to state monitoring is the hallmark of the ""road to serfdom"" Hayek warned against. Travel has been long marked by the faux theatre of security arrangements that do not really secure - off with the belt, empty that water bottle - but generate plenty of quasi-intimidating activity. COVID theatre has marked a good deal of our pandemic policy for the past sixteen months. Now with international travel opening up, the performance has come to the airport. It isn't pretty.

Rex Murphy: How COVID-19 taught the public to distrust the authorities,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/rex-murphy-how-covid-19-taught-the-public-to-distrust-the-authorities,nationalpost.com,"We discovered there was not one set of rules for all, and that even the strictest medical advice could be trumped by political considerations",['Rex Murphy'],2021-09-28 00:00:00,"Photo by Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press Early on during the pandemic, it was easy to accept that the politicians, guided by their selected cadre of experts, knew what they were doing. And there was likewise in the public mind a considerable reservoir of trust in their pronouncements, which was not diminished if - in the very early days - a caution or a recommendation put out one week was altered, revised, or even contradicted by a caution or recommendation the week following. So for example the first request of the public was to put up with a shutdown of two weeks ""to slow down the curve."" Certainly no one was happy about it, but everyone gave it a quick ""yes."" Even when there was something of a small panic about the shortage of ventilators (which probably should have been on medical stockpile), that did not really disturb the public's confidence. We heard from Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam that ""Canada's risk is much, much lower than that of many countries. (COVID) is going to be rare."" Alas, we have learned throughout the past nearly two years that that declaration was a wild and very, very wrong surmise. That declaration was a wild and very, very wrong surmise And as the anxieties of the population began to swell and the question of whether face masks would be a useful or necessary safeguard, at a time when face masks were not abundantly available here in Canada, Tam was ready with advice on those as well: ""Putting a mask on an asymptomatic person is not beneficial, obviously if you're not infected,"" she said. But when, just seven days later, the same front figure of the federal response to COVID-19 did a full 180-degree turn and returned to her podium to urge the benefit, if not the necessity of face masks, you could sense the turbulence in the public's confident reception in what the political and medical authorities were urging and ordering. It would take the whole column and a few more besides to catalogue the declarations and decrees which came down from Ottawa only to be - same phrase - altered, revised, or even contradicted a week or month after their initial commanding iteration. But these pronouncements, uttered in the first instance with great authority and then reversed with even greater aplomb, began to grate. There was a succession of them, right up to the present moment, on whether we should have travel bans, whether there should be quarantines, whether people landing in our airports from other countries should be getting tested, or whether it was OK that some were just landing, picking up their baggage and going their way. More On This Topic Rex Murphy: You want to eat that doughnut here? Show me your papers Rex Murphy: Did you spot the hypocrite(s) at the G7 summit? Then there were the discrepancies in the application of closures and lockdowns. ""Necessary"" services were allowed to operate - grocery stores, trucking, and curiously, Big Box stores - but ""unnecessary"" services were to close. Gyms, barbershops, shoe stores, indeed any retail outlet, big or small, that didn't belong in a chosen category, were to close totally. And people were urged or ordered to stay away from work, unless of course they were, prime example, clerks in the grocery and food outlets. There was another discrepancy, too, this one financial, and it never has, to this moment, received the full attention it should have. All civil servants, teachers, those on any public contract, remained on permanent payroll, while those in the private sector - even with the CERB payments and other federal assistance - were being brutalized by the closures. This was nowhere more obviously than in the restaurant and hospitality industries, but almost every trade, from taxi-driving to sales, was hit very hard as well. While people kept hearing the Liberal mantras - ""we all in this together, and we've got your back "" - it was clear some backs could claim more shielding (and got it) than others, and ""all"" and ""together"" did not quite carry the weight both terms should aspire to. It was clear some backs could claim more shielding than others But there was one discrepancy that towered above all the rest. This was made evident in early June, 2020, when gatherings of thousands of people were permitted to protest the death of George Floyd despite the fact lockdowns were universal in North America and people normally caught amassing in groups larger than five or 10, other than with immediate family members, were either chastened, charged, ridiculed or all three. ""How selfish they are"" was the cry against these ‘lawbreakers,"" a cry we're hearing much more vehemently about those reluctant or opposed to mandated vaccinations and passports. I'll deal with that in the next column. This was the very period when antifa was roaring nightly through some North American cities, and the Black Lives Matter movement was at its public relations pinnacle; the period when ""taking a knee"" was the curious posture of rebellion, and demonstrations in the U.S., and yes here in Canada, too, were almost daily. That's also when a veritable multitude of ""medical authorities"" - 1,200 of them in fact - thought it both necessary and enlightened to issue a major media statement . They posted a letter - not a Luther at the Wittenberg church door moment its signatories evidently thought it to be. ""We created (this) letter in response to emerging narratives that seemed to malign demonstrations as risky for the public health because of COVID-19 … We wanted to present a narrative that prioritizes opposition to racism as vital to the public health, including the epidemic response ."" (My emphasis.) Photo by DAVE CHAN/AFP Now was that not Interesting,? Protest demonstrations as public health prophylactics - better than vaccines? The point was then explicitly made: ""We do not condemn these gatherings as risky for COVID-19 transmission."" Everyone else was told to stay at home, avoid congregating, people walking dogs in the wrong places were arrested, barber shops were shut down .. but here were ""medical authorities"" essentially saying that gathering in the thousands, for the right cause, ""was … vital to public health."" Up here in shutdown-mad Canada, there were a number of those ""vital to public health"" protests, and one was attended by no less than the prime minister himself, who duly ""took a knee."" This was the moment that skepticism of the authorities was powerfully launched and the public recognized there was not one set of rules for all, and that even the strictest medical advice could easily, almost triumphantly, be trumped by political considerations.

Opinion: It would be selfish to vaccinate our children while so many adults around the world lack access to a vaccine,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion,nationalpost.com,Hundreds of thousands of lives could be saved globally by diverting our supply to developing countries,"['Zain Chagla', 'Srinivas Murthy', 'Special To National Post']",2021-05-13 00:00:00,"Photo by Justin Sullivan / Getty Images The advent of effective vaccines has given us hope that there is a light at the end of the tunnel of the COVID-19 crisis. With both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada having authorized the use of the Pfizer vaccine in children over 12 years old, and with lower age groups likely to be authorized in the coming months, many are looking forward to seeing entire populations vaccinated and life returning to normal. While this may seem promising, it ignores the suffering of the world around us, much of which has minimal access to vaccines for people of any age. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu, the director of the World Health Organization, said, ""I understand why some countries want to vaccinate their children and adolescents, but right now I urge them to reconsider and to instead donate vaccines to COVAX (the global vaccine repository)."" The rationale is simple: children face a lower risk of death from COVID-19 as compared to adults. Many adults around the world do not have any idea when they will gain access to a vaccine. Even countries with large-scale vaccine manufacturing capabilities, like India, could see millions of more deaths throughout the summer, due to the more transmissible variants. Health systems in many countries are on the brink of collapse, which threatens to further endanger local populations. The use of measures such as lockdowns in areas of the world with scarce housing and immense poverty only magnifies problems of malnutrition, inequitable education and instability. The numbers are not trivial. There are approximately 150 million children under 18 years old in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada and the European Union. If they all get vaccinated in the short term, that's 300 million doses that would be diverted from adults in the developing world. If one were to put those vaccines into adults instead of children, based on our calculations, 150,000 lives would be saved globally, compared to 1,100 pediatric lives if they were reserved for children in rich countries. And this doesn't include the number of pediatric lives that would be saved in the developing world by having more adults vaccinated, further lowering exposure risk. Nor does this number take into account more transmissible variants, access to health care or the increased mortality when health systems are overloaded, so it likely vastly underestimates the lives that would be saved by vaccinating adults in the developing world. Many worry about the consequences of their children contracting COVID-19, and the potential to develop long COVID. Yet children in countries that lack access to vaccines face an even higher risk of acquiring COVID19, dying of COVID-19 and developing long COVID, due to the higher rates of community transmission. Furthermore, children from low- and middle-income countries face the risk of losing their parents from COVID-19 - data from the United States suggests 37,000 children have lost a parent, and the number will be much higher in South Asia. Moreover, the continued spread of COVID-19 in the developing world will lead to other adverse outcomes in children, including reduced access to health care for non-COVID issues, reduced access to vaccines used to prevent other ailments, increased mental health challenges and worsened educational outcomes. Hence, even taking this from a pediatric lens, children around the world will likely suffer more if there is an inequitable vaccine rollout. The question we always receive when this is proposed is whether high-income countries can return to normal without immunizing children. The answer is yes: vaccinating adults has been effective in preventing COVID-19 transmission in children. Israel, for example, is seeing a significant reduction in childhood cases, due to its large-scale vaccination campaign among adults. It is important that policymakers recognize that the global vaccination campaign risks being derailed by aggressive new variants that are less susceptible to the vaccine. Such variants are more likely to arise in places where COVID continues to spread unchecked. Our political leaders must clearly state that ""getting back to normal"" is a meaningless goal if it means tens of thousands of excess deaths globally. We need to start thinking of this pandemic as a global issues that requires global solutions. Ending this pandemic with the least lives lost, the least impact on children, the least impact on our economy and in the shortest amount of time requires us to specifically prioritize sharing our vaccine supply before pushing forward with all-age vaccinations in high-income countries. Most importantly, solving the current global scarcity of vaccines will have the largest impact on making these arguments less relevant, which should be our ultimate goal. Both of us are fathers and infectious disease physicians, and if the vaccines are found to be safe and effective in children, we would enthusiastically immunize our own. However, recognizing that the small benefit to our children could come at the cost of tens of thousands of lives gives us pause. Global vaccine equity - making sure those at the highest risk are vaccinated before those at the lowest risk - is important as we try to bring this pandemic to an end.

LILLEY: Ontario's opposition parties want more restrictions here,https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/lilley-cases-spike-in-europe-so-ontarios-opposition-parties-want-more-restrictions-here,torontosun.com,Citing rising cases “with many European countries having to re-impose restrictions” the Liberals demanded action from Ford here in Ontario.,['Brian Lilley'],2021-11-15 00:00:00,"LILLEY: Cases spike in Europe so Ontario's opposition parties want more restrictions here LILLEY: Cases spike in Europe so Ontario's opposition parties want more restrictions here Photo by Jan Hetfleisch / Getty Images When the story came in about Austria heading back into lockdowns, for the unvaccinated at least, I wondered how long before there would be calls for more restrictions here. I didn't have to wait long, Ontario's opposition was making the call before lunch. ""Doug Ford seems to be doing nothing to stop yet another deadly, but preventable fifth wave of COVID-19,"" Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca said in a news release. LILLEY: Cases spike in Europe so Ontario's opposition parties want more restrictions here ""Why will this premier not guarantee the same level of protection for patients and students and stop coddling anti-vaxxers?"" NDP Leader Andrea Horwath asked during Question Period while demanding the Ford government mandate vaccinations for all health and education workers. For Ontario's opposition parties there is never enough government action to deal with COVID-19 and even when the situation has improved, they only see doom and gloom. They also seem to believe that the spread of COVID-19 in Ontario is firmly and solely the fault of Doug Ford despite this being a worldwide pandemic and Canada - and Ontario - having better outcomes than most countries. In Austria, where they just announced new measures, cases have increased 133% over the last two weeks. By comparison, cases in Canada are down 8% over the last two weeks while Ontario's cases have gone up slightly. Austria's cases per capita are still more than 20 times the Ontario rate. The same when it comes to COVID-19 deaths. Austria's COVID deaths are at five times the rate of Canada's and rising, Ontario's death rate from COVID is less than half the national average. You can compare Canada's numbers to countries like the United States or Mexico or to much of Europe where they, like us, are headed towards winter and Canada comes out better in most cases. Consider then that Ontario has some of the best numbers in Canada among the provinces and you are left wondering what is driving their agenda? It's not just doom and gloom or keeping the public in perpetual fear of COVID-19, they want to use the pandemic to push a political agenda. Look to the solutions or list of demands that the NDP and Liberals put forward and it most often resembles the lists put out by Ontario's public-sector unions like the teachers or nurses. They want smaller class sizes, a pay increase for nurses and 10 paid sick days. Those aren't measures designed to fight the pandemic, those are demands that the unions were making before we had ever heard of COVID-19. Now the NDP and Liberals are using the tragedy of rising cases elsewhere and calling for a return of restrictions even as Ontario's Chief Medical Officer has taken an optimistic outlook. ""Honestly, I do not see us stepping backwards,"" Dr. Kieran Moore said last week. ""If we have to, we'll pause, but we won't take a step backwards.""

Maybe we should get Horwath and Del Duca talking to Moore more often to see if that optimism will rub off.

"GRANT: Vaccines will never eliminate COVID, so it's time to pivot our response",https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/grant-vaccines-will-never-eliminate-covid-so-its-time-to-pivot-our-response,torontosun.com,"When COVID started, I was convinced that we wouldn’t have a vaccine.",['Dr. Jennifer M. Grant'],2021-11-23 00:00:00,"Photo by Luke Hendry / Postmedia Network This wasn't simply pessimism, I based my opinion on our experience with other Coronaviruses. Specific attempts to create vaccines for SARS-CoV (the original) and MERS-CoV had been complicated by what's known as ""antibody dependent immune enhancement "" - a fancy way of saying some people had worse disease after vaccination. I had a good helping of humble pie when we developed not only 1, but 155 vaccine candidates, and 24 licenced vaccines in less than 2 years. Even more amazing, the available COVID vaccines, especially the mRNA versions, were developed and deployed in record time, and were more than 90% effective in reducing symptomatic disease. As we began to vaccinate through the spring of 2021, cases fell precipitously. We had won. This is when we got greedy. The initial promise of a vaccine with sterilizing immunity (ability to stop infections and transmission), brought the prospect of disease elimination tantalizing close. Now, in the late fall of 2021, it is becoming obvious that while vaccines are still incredibly effective at stopping severe disease , they are less so at stopping transmission . So where does that leave us? The obvious, and generally accepted , conclusion is that current vaccine technologies will not stop viral circulation. This means that SARS-CoV-2 is destined to become the 5 th circulating coronavirus, with which everybody is eventually infected. Canada's unspoken strategy has been that of COVID Zero , including strict border quarantines, widespread masking mandates, school closures and more. This is the same strategy that is being abandoned by Australia and New Zealand . The only option is to change to an endemic approach, which changes the emphasis on vaccination and prevention efforts. This means that for people at risk of severe disease, vaccine is now more important. However, the incessant drive to an arbitrary percent of the population being vaccinated has ceased to make sense: It is not how many are vaccinated, but whom that matters. For example, vaccinating 100 people over the age of 65 is likely to prevent 3 hospitalizations, while vaccinating a 2000 member high school or university class is unlikely to avoid any. Time and effort need to go to identifying communities of high-risk unvaccinated people, understanding their reasons for hesitancy and working with them towards acceptance of vaccines. The next pivotal change is to stop counting cases and concentrate instead on outcomes with personal and social impact. Testing everybody with a cold is expensive and ultimately futile if we all eventually end up infected. Hospitalizations and deaths become the only metric that matters. Politicians need to abandon the quixotic quest for COVID zero, making many of the interventions intended to stop virus circulation irrelevant. Public mask-wearing, social distancing etc. were only going to defer, not eliminate, transmission. Canada is in 10 th place in the world with almost 80% of the population vaccinated ; The highest risk ages (above 60) are 90% or higher. Much like the UK, Norway and much of the rest of Europe, we need to return to normal. Society also needs to shift how it sees the unvaccinated. The prevailing opinion, including among many of my colleagues, is that the unvaccinated pose a threat to others. Since the vaccinated are still likely to be infected and transmit disease, with similar viral loads as those who are unvaccinated, this is not entirely true. We want high risk, non-immune, people to be vaccinated for their own protection and to reduce the impact on hospitals and health care systems. However, the unvaccinated are not a threat to patrons at a supermarket or ski hill . In fact, it is the unvaccinated who are at risk in crowded situations. This means, at the very least, that the use of vaccine passports beyond the very limited recommendations of public health read more as moral panic, or vigilante justice, than a public health intervention. Finally, we need to think very carefully about how we approach vaccination in the very low risk parts of the population, particularly children. The FDA deliberations included significant concern about applying the same criteria to this very low-risk population as is applied to older groups. If we assume that everybody gets infected, and that young people almost never end up in hospital, the need to limit youth activities with mandates or exclusion becomes less defensible. We need to stop penalizing the young for being young, even in those who are unvaccinated. Youth need to socialize, engage with their peers and develop their physical and mental abilities. It would have been great if we could have had a vaccine that would allow us to eliminate COVID. But, even if we don't, vaccines for COVID have been a miracle, saving millions of lives. Rather than resent our inability to produce the vaccine that we wanted, let's celebrate the vaccine that we have, and use them to get life back to normal. - Dr. Jennifer Grant is an infectious diseases physician and a Clinical Associate Professor at the University of British Columbia's Faculty of Medicine.

FUREY: More nuance is needed around the kids' vaccine discussion,https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/furey-more-nuance-is-needed-around-the-kids-vaccine-discussion,torontosun.com,"On Tuesday evening, Health Canada posted to Twitter that it would take “months” for them to review Pfizer’s submission concerning vaccines for children, ages…",['Anthony Furey'],2021-11-07 00:00:00,"Photo by Tom Brenner / REUTERS On Tuesday evening, Health Canada posted to Twitter that it would take ""months"" for them to review Pfizer's submission concerning vaccines for children, ages five to 11. This came the same day that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control approved the roll-out for that same vaccine in that same age group. Social media being what it is, some people hit the roof, lashing out at Health Canada for that statement. They wanted the vaccine approved that very second, not a couple of months down the road. Health Canada later deleted that post and added a clarification, stating: ""That was incorrect. The review will take weeks, not months."" But those who were upset by the first statement shouldn't mistake this clarification for an endorsement of the view that all kids need to get the vaccine and need to get it as soon as possible. That's not what the experts are saying. It's not even what Pfizer and the U.S. bodies that approved the vaccine are saying. It's a much more nuanced discussion. Yet, these nuances haven't been filtering down to Canadian parents as much as they should be. While the FDA advisory committee voted 17-0 (with one abstaining) last week to move ahead with the Pfizer kids' vaccine, there were caveats. The big one was that the committee asked multiple times about being able to instead vote on initially just approving it for high-risk kids. But the FDA insisted they vote on approving it for all. ""It just seems to me that in some ways, we're vaccinating children to protect the adults, and it should be the other way around,"" said FDA committee member Dr. James Hildreth. ""I do believe that children at highest risk do need to be vaccinated. But vaccinating all of the children … that seems a bit much for me."" Not even Pfizer seems to be pushing for mass vaccination of all kids in the same way some voices on social media demand. In their briefing document to the FDA, Pfizer says ""the benefits of the (kids') vaccine are highly dependent on the incidence of COVID-19."" Pfizer lays out one scenario - based on where transmission rates were at for June 2021 - where the vaccine actually creates more hospitalizations in kids due to heart issues than it would prevent hospitalizations due to COVID-19. The challenge with talking about potential side effects in kids is that the number enrolled in Pfizer's study is quite small. Only 1,518 kids received the shot (with 750 getting the placebo). And yet, what caused Ontario health officials to recommend against young males receiving Moderna was a 1 in 5,000 incidence rate of myocarditis. It's perhaps for these reasons and more that, according to Angus Reid Institute, only about half of Canadian parents are eager to see their little ones vaccinated soon after it becomes available. While Health Canada may not be months away from making a determination, that poll showed many parents plan to wait several months until giving it to their kids. ""We need to temper our enthusiasm until we have safety data from a larger group of children. The Pfizer study looked at just over 1,500 kids with a short follow-up period,"" wrote Dr. Martha Fulford, a pediatric infectious diseases physician based out of Hamilton, in an email to the Toronto Sun. ""While it is reasonable to consider vaccinating some children early, such as very high-risk children, we need the safety data and longer-term effectiveness data before any generalized recommendation can be made."" The issue of vaccinating kids is clearly much more complicated than the adult vaccine roll-out. Let's hope this gets the widespread acknowledgment it deserves.

It's looking like this may sadly be one of the more tense and divided parts of the pandemic response to date. There are the vaccine exuberant, who are desperate to see their kids first in line. There are those who, for various reasons, are opposed to having their kids vaccinated. And then, if pollsters are to be believed, there are the 65% of Canadians who are OK with extending vaccine passport restrictions to this age bracket. But whatever category a parent falls into, they'd be wise to take a few minutes to read the report by Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) outlining the agency's rationale behind approving the vaccine. Because it's a far less enthusiastic endorsement than a lot of news reports and doctors weighing in on social media would have you believe. For starters, while NACI doesn't make any public policy pronouncements, they clearly don't support extending the passport system to kids. ""It is essential that children aged 5-11 years and their parents are supported and respected in their decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccinations for their children, whatever decisions they make, and are not stigmatized for accepting, or not accepting, the vaccination offer,"" the report states. In fact, when it comes to approving the vaccine, all they say is that it ""may be"" now offered to kids. They explain that ""[g]iven the short- term uncertainties surrounding pediatric vaccination at this time, children and their parents or guardians should be supported and respected in their decisions."" One of the uncertainties they're referring to is potential hospitalizations for vaccine-related myocarditis. The report points out that the fact the kids' doses are a third of the volume will hopefully minimize these problems, but they state how ""[t]he overall safety and effectiveness data are limited for children."" A lot of parents likely don't realize that the trial size for kids was quite small, and the NACI report explains that: ""Any uncommon, rare, or very rare [side effect] that occurs at the frequency less often than 1 in 1,000 would not be detected with this trial size."" Keep in mind that Ontario health officials now recommend against young males taking Moderna due to a myocarditis rate that was 1 in 5,000. It's because of similar concerns that the FDA advisory committee in the United States was initially hoping to approve the kids' vaccine only for high-risk kids first before extending it to all ages. While the politicians may be making big statements about how all kids need to get this vaccine as soon as possible, that's clearly not what those experts approving it in both Canada and the U.S. are saying. The other thing that these experts are also not saying is that myocarditis is more commonly caused from COVID-19 than it is from the vaccine. While this has become a popular talking point used by many Canadian doctors, they fail to differentiate age cohorts when making this claim. While this may prove correct for older persons, there is no evidence to indicate that this is true for our youth. In Ontario, there have only been 86 kids aged 5-11 hospitalized with COVID-19 to date. Although we know from federal data that the majority of these numbers are believed to be incidental hospitalizations, meaning that the kids were admitted for something else - such as a broken arm - and just happened to test positive for the virus upon admittance but are not actually true COVID hospitalizations. The real number, pediatricians have told the Sun, is considered more in the 40 range. Now compare that number to the fact that, according to a Public Health Ontario report, as of Sept. 4 there were 52 Ontario kids in the 12-17 age bracket hospitalized for myocarditis following Pfizer vaccination. (That number has only increased since then and an updated report is expected shortly.) The facts show that it's deeply problematic for doctors to be telling parents that myocarditis is more common from the virus than the vaccine as if this holds true for youth. That's probably why NACI doesn't make this claim, but instead humbly acknowledges the unknown aspects currently surrounding kids' COVID-19 vaccines. Parents would do well to read NACI's report when considering these issues.

A new variant was coming, and we were told it could be much worse. Every hour a new country announced they were implementing border restrictions covering half a dozen south African countries. For some it was scary because they assumed the worst about the virus. For others, it was scary because it looked like we were collectively willing ourselves towards a series of cascading effects that could shut society down once again. And yet this isn't early 2020. We've learned so much. But we don't always act like it. It's long overdue that Canada drops the COVID alarmism cycle, where we sit ready to be fed bad news and then immediately call for shutdowns. The problem is it's our new Pavlovian response. The past 20 months have been habit forming. Shutting down schools, for example, is not a normal thing to do. Yet we've normalized it. An accounting of how this came to be will no doubt be the subject of many books in the years to come. So I'll just narrow in on one factor: We're not amplifying the info that will allow us to step away from the alarmism. And by we, I specifically mean Canada. Since late August, liberal Massachusetts has had a daily average of about 1,500 cases. Given that the state is around half the population of Ontario, that's like my home province having over 3,000 daily cases. Also, their vaccination rate is much lower than ours, at 70%. There is no doubt that if Ontario had the same case numbers as Massachusetts, people would go nuts demanding to be plunged back into lockdown. Yet life there goes on. There's no statewide mask mandate and no vaccine passport. In the summer Boston's Democratic Mayor Kim Janey even compared vaccine passports to slavery. (Janey, who is Black, later walked back the comments.) It seems likely that one of the reasons the U.S., regardless of region or political affiliation, has had a more balanced COVID-19 response is because it has more balanced media coverage. There have been features in mainstream liberal publications that pose challenging questions concerning masking, closures and vaccine passports and mandates, but few, if any, here. While Canadian media typically amplifies American news, the reports on how the U.S. is learning to live with COVID rarely make news here. Instead, we see it on social media or hear it from people returning from vacation, like those from East Berlin who climbed the wall only to return and tell the tale of life on the other side. Although it's not like we even do a good job discussing our domestic facts. A year ago, I wrote about how Alberta data revealed that over 75% of their COVID deaths were in people suffering from three or more underlying conditions, suggesting that the risk of serious outcomes to the virus was not as wide-reaching as blunt public health communications led us to believe at the time. Instead of running their own version of the story or simply ignoring it, a CBC reporter proceeded to write a hit piece involving my article, and then Health Minister Patty Hajdu denounced my piece as ""fake and dangerous news"" in the House of Commons. (Almost a year later, the CBC ombudsman wrote that my piece was ""accurate"" and the CBC piece on my story was ""flawed."" Hajdu, though, never retracted her remarks.) Most people likely still don't know that important bit of context out of Alberta. The problem is that we amplify and internalize COVID data that holds us back while ignoring or downplaying the facts that should empower us to move forward. Did you know that official hospitalization rates include some people who remained asymptomatic and just happened to test positive for the virus upon arrival but were admitted to hospital for something completely different than COVID? Did you know that in Ontario ""cases in schools"" just refers to people who attend school who have tested positive, and that actual transmission in schools, according to officials, is very low? Did you know that Dr. Theresa Tam signed off on a pandemic plan in 2018 that presumed much worse infection rates than we're dealing with now but would still see everything stay open? We really need to talk this sort of stuff out more than we've been doing. Because the next time a variant comes around the corner and tells us to jump, it would be good if fewer people responded with ""how high?""

Tristin Hopper: Canada is kicking butt on COVID. Why are we still locked down?,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/tristin-hopper-canada-is-kicking-butt-on-covid-why-are-we-still-locked-down,nationalpost.com,All this mass-vaccination has delivered a near-miraculous turnaround in COVID-19 numbers,['Tristin Hopper'],2021-06-05 00:00:00,"Photo by Ian Willms/Getty Images Last week, Canada officially became the top country on earth for single-dose vaccine coverage. More than 63 per cent of Canadians - roughly 23.7 million people - have received at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine. While we lag behind the rest of the world in terms of fully vaccinated citizens, there is no place on earth that can boast a larger share of the citizenry carrying at least some immunity to COVID-19. . Canada's rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations is n ow tied with the United States . Deaths, too, have dropped off a cliff from their January peak . COVID-19 now has a daily death rate of about one in every 1.2 million Canadians. The 17 deaths logged on Sunday make COVID-19 currently about as deadly as Canada's usual tally of flu and pneumonia deaths . Although Canada has seen the presence of the Delta variant since April, there is evidence that while the Indian-origin variant is more transmissible, vaccines are still effective against it. Monday data from Public Health England showed that a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine is 94 per cent effective at preventing hospitalization from the Delta variant, while a single dose of AstraZeneca provides 71 per cent protection. Here's the key table from @PHE_uk new report on vaccine efficacy against hospitalisation with Delta variant: After 1 dose • Pfizer: 94% effective • AstraZeneca: 71% effective After 2 doses • Pfizer: 96% • AstraZeneca: 92% Full preprint here: https://t.co/JQQjo0gSdg pic.twitter.com/osSjIZ0eA6 - John Burn-Murdoch (@jburnmurdoch) June 14, 2021 Despite all this good news, Canada remains one of the most locked-down countries on earth, particularly in Ontario. Schools are closed. Indoor dining remains banned. And places of worship remain under tight strictures. As Canada extends its various lockdowns well beyond anything that would make epidemiological sense, it's unfortunately well in keeping with a pandemic policy that has consistently favoured blunt lockdowns over targeted responses designed to minimize peripheral harm. Since the beginning of the pandemic, a team at Oxford University has maintained a ""stringency index"" tracking 23 indicators of the strictness of a country's lockdown. As of this writing, Canada stands at 73.61 on the index - one of the highest the country has been all pandemic. It's a stringency not too far removed from the 81.93 seen in India, which is currently reeling from the world's deadliest single COVID wave. Canada's stringency rate is also well above the U.S. rate of 46.76 and the U.K. rate of 62.5. Ontario schools remain closed until the fall. This is not only out of step with the rest of Canada, but the rest of the world's other mass-vaccinated countries. When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appeared last week at the G7 summit, he was the only representative of a country where nearly one half of school-age children are still not allowed to attend classes in person. While the United States spent much of the pandemic closing its schools in tandem with Canada, as early as March virtually every state had reopened . Notably, even as the U.K. now considers delaying an end to social distancing measures amid rising Delta variant cases, it has kept schools open . Ontario and Quebec continue to hold firm to what is shaping up to be the world's longest ban on indoor dining . Indoor dining even at limited capacity remains banned throughout the province of Ontario. France, which boasts many of the same dropping COVID-19 numbers as Ontario, opened half-capacity indoor dining last week . Across the border, 29 U.S. states are now operating indoor dining without any restrictions . Most notably, even as Canada swells its ranks of people for whom COVID-19 is effectively harmless, governments are dragging their feet at exempting them from ongoing restrictions. Three million Canadians have now received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine - a proportion of the country larger than the combined population of Atlantic Canada. While full vaccination is not a perfect shield against infection, the risk drops so precipitously that after two shots the COVID-19 virus becomes roughly as likely to kill you as the common flu . Despite this, Canada will spend the rest of the month continuing to force fully-vaccinated citizens to submit to mandatory 14-day quarantine after returning home from abroad (and will force them to enter a quarantine hotel when returning by air). Even when relaxed border restrictions come in July , Ottawa will still require fully vaccinated citizens to show up at the border with a negative COVID-19 test, and to self-isolate while waiting for a second test. This is a level of caution well beyond that of countries that have already started to open their borders to vaccinated travelers: France and Greece, for instance, will waive all testing requirements if travelers can show proof of vaccination . Photo by Photo by Ian Willms/Getty Images Canada's hesitancy to grant exemptions to the vaccinated also risks jeopardizing its $4.2 billion cruise ship industry. Ottawa is maintaining a standing federal ban on cruise ship arrivals until at least February 2022 even amid industry plans to only sail with at least 95 per cent of passengers vaccinated. As has become obvious to anyone watching the playoffs, Canada's NHL arenas have remained closed except for the occasional contingent of vaccinated healthcare workers. Meanwhile, arenas across the U.S. are packing in crowds of up to 12,000 if fans can provide proof of vaccination . Stefan Baral is a Canadian-born epidemiologist with the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. He told the National Post in a note that Canada and its stricter provinces could do well to follow a pandemic strategy that is ""responsive to where risks are."" COVID-19 has always been a disease that disproportionately affects the elderly, those with known pre-existing conditions as well as workers in select professions, such as meat processing plants. Despite this, lockdowns such as bans on outdoor recreation have often applied restrictions across entire populations without accounting for differential risk. Baral pointed to Ontario's limited attention on long-term care homes - which saw some of the worst death rates all pandemic - in favour of broad restrictions on gyms and dining. ""In Ontario, the differences in risk by occupation, income, and household risks have been significant throughout and other than the pop-up vaccination, there has been limited attention to trying to address those needs,"" said Baral.

Opinion: Free speech isn't free. It comes with a price,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-free-speech-isnt-free-it-comes-with-a-price,nationalpost.com,It's tempting to say the danger posed by anti-vaxxers would justify their views being banned. That would be wrong,['National Post'],2021-07-04 00:00:00,"Photo by Justin Tang/The Canadian Press By Dr. Harry Rakowski Countries led by undemocratic leaders fear free speech the most because it undermines the falsehoods they promote and the corruption best kept hidden in order to prop up their governments. In Russia, Alexei Navalny is jailed for unmasking the riches that Vladimir Putin has assembled. In China, internet access is controlled lest the ""wrong"" - that is the truthful - message can be heard on a broad scale. In Hong Kong, guaranteed freedoms disappear, critics are silenced and the opposition newspaper is closed so that only the party line can be voiced. Western countries greatly value freedom of speech and the freedom to voice unpopular opinions as a key element of a functioning democracy. Their judicial systems vigorously uphold that right. Yet more and more we are seeing an erosion of free speech when an opinion goes against popular belief and thus needs to be censored. Censorship is deemed necessary when ideas are thought to possibly harm societal norms or don't fit our supposed truths. On the surface it sounds reasonable but on deeper reflection it isn't. It leads to even greater societal polarization and distrust of authority. Institutions are allowed to deceive, but individuals need to maintain a higher standard and be silenced. Governments regularly cover up mistakes to avoid public embarrassment. Our current government is in breach of Parliament for heavily redacting documents that detail why two Chinese scientists were fired from a Winnipeg virology lab. The argument that the truth would somehow harm national security smells like the same argument unsuccessfully used by Richard Nixon to deny access to his self-incriminating Watergate tapes. Governments regularly cover up mistakes to avoid public embarrassment The Catholic church has long hidden the shameful sexual abuse by priests. Now even a highly compassionate and respected pope seems unable to fully acknowledge the role played by the church in the tragedy of abuse and death that occurred in residential homes for Indigenous children. Large corporations have successfully avoided paying their fair share of taxes. Donald Trump's organization is under indictment for tax fraud. The tobacco industry has a history of denying the undeniable link of smoking to cancer and heart disease. I have been sent a number of articles and videos that challenge the conventional wisdom about the effects of COVID-19, the need for masks and the wisdom of vaccination. Some postulate a conspiracy by the ruling class, Bill Gates and Big Pharma to purposefully deceive the public for their own gain. Some authors are convinced that Anthony Fauci caused the pandemic by his agency funding viral research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. More On This Topic Harry Rakowski: Delaying second shot of COVID-19 vaccine dangerous for those at high risk Harry Rakowski: Simple blood test detects clotting from AstraZeneca vaccine early enough to treat The best lies take an element of truth and distort it to make their point of view more believable. The conspiracies promoted build on our growing mistrust of authority and the deceptions that have occurred in the past. COVID-19 isn't just the flu. The millions of people worldwide who have died due to becoming infected is a truth that cannot be ignored. The tremendous reduction in case counts, hospitalization and death rates due to vaccination is undeniable. The risks of the ever growing impact of the Delta variant is cause for ongoing concern and creates urgent need for overcoming vaccine hesitancy. Given these facts and the risks of ignoring them, how should we deal with those who deny them in print, blogs and social media? Should we still their voices for the public good? Many advocates of these theories appear to be highly qualified and intelligent, perhaps making their distortion of the facts more compelling and thus more dangerous. Freedom of speech is protected under the First Amendment in the U.S. and by Section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. There are however notable exceptions to this protection. In the U.S., obscenity, hate speech, defamation, fraud and incitement are exceptions that have narrow and careful limitations so that free speech remains protected. In Canada the government is also allowed to enforce similar narrowly defined exceptions to free speech protected by Section 2 of the Charter. Should we still their voices for the public good? It is tempting to say that the danger caused by those opposing vaccination, or exaggerating its short- and long-term risks, meets the standards for exceptions to free speech and thus should be banned. It may be of short-term benefit but long-term harm. Banning unpopular speech simply drives it underground to websites that feed into the belief that censorship of ideas is rampant and is the result of biased government and inappropriate regulation. It increases the current worrisome polarization of thought and cancelling of those with unpopular ideas. It increases the militancy of those denied a voice. There are also times when banned or ridiculed speech turns out to be true. COVID-19 may have started as a lab leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Such opinion was at risk of being banned. Democracy is about allowing ideas to be discussed and debated. We have to trust that most people can understand the facts and come to a sensible conclusion. Open discussion fosters trust and the confirmation that we are free to speak our minds, even if not always correct or politically correct. Free speech isn't free. It comes with a price. People may accept untruths that can harm them or society. However cancelling free speech has a higher price. It is another step down a slippery slope to autocracy that is even more dangerous. Einstein said, ""Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds."" We have to accept that while most bad ideas are wrong, we can't stifle the creativity and unconventional thinking that uncovers great ideas. The Earth is not flat!

GUNTER: A reality check about the impracticalities of vaccine mandates,https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/gunter-a-reality-check-about-the-impracticalities-of-vaccine-mandates,torontosun.com,Apparently I set off a bit of a storm in the travel industry last week.,['Lorne Gunter'],2021-10-30 00:00:00,"Photo by JEAN-CHRISTOPHE VERHAEGEN / AFP via Getty Images Last Sunday I said Transport Canada had quietly extended the deadline for air and rail travellers to be fully vaccinated from Oct. 30 to Nov. 30. Indeed, the announcement had been so quiet, most travel agents and even some airlines hadn't been told. Here's the exactly wording from Transport Canada's official release: ""Effective October 30, travellers departing from Canadian airports, and travellers on VIA Rail and Rocky Mountaineer trains, will be required to be fully vaccinated in order to travel. To allow travellers time to become fully vaccinated, there will be a short transition period where they will be able to travel if they show a valid COVID-19 molecular test within 72 hours of travel as an alternative to providing proof of full vaccination."" That grace period will last until at least November 30. Like lots of other governments and agencies, Transport Canada is finding it difficult to enforce an airtight vaccine mandate. Set aside for now that most governments have been told internally their get-vaccinated-or-get-fired requirements are almost certainly unconstitutional. For nearly three decades, until this week, the opinion from Health Canada was that ""vaccines cannot be made mandatory because of the Canadian Constitution."" Justice Canada has reportedly told the prime minister's office the same thing. And even if mandates are legal, practicality is throwing a wrench into governments' get-tough approaches. In Quebec, 2,000 or more nurses remain unvaccinated. Do we really believe Quebec is going to lay off 2,000 frontline workers in the middle of a public health emergency? Alberta Health Services says seven per cent of its 108,000-person workforce remains unjabbed? Will they be unemployed by next week? Is the government of B.C. truly going to furlough 4,000 or more hospital staff? And if not nurses and doctors, then how can governments justify dismissing tens of thousands of vaccine-hesitant lab techs and respiratory therapists? Even teachers, police officers and rec centre staff? More and more we are seeing the cold, hard truth of mandates dawning on tough-talking political leaders and government officials. Canada Post announced this week its employees only have to be making an effort towards getting fully immunized. They won't have to show proof of full vaccination until sometime early next year. (No sense missing out on all that well-paying Christmas parcel business.) Federal judges will not have to prove full vaccination, ever. Period. The Privy Council Office said Thursday, ""The judiciary is independent."" Apparently more independent than you, if you're not a judge and your employer has told you to get your shots or get fired. Edmonton Transit, the outfit that runs the public buses and light-rail trains in Alberta's capital, announced this week it will cut back service on some routes because 15 drivers remain unvaxed. However, for the other seven per cent of city workers who are similarly unvaccinated, rapid antigen tests will be enough to keep working. There was always going to have to be a Plan B. Even though people who work for government are probably, as a group, more willing to comply with government orders than the general population, there was never going to be 100 per cent compliance with vaccine mandates among public-sector workers,. A percentage in the low 90s is probably the best governments can hope for from their own workers. We have too many public-sector workers at all levels, but there is no guarantee the ones who are unvaccinated correspond perfectly with the group we need to get rid off. Are governments really going to fire one-in-10 or one-in-11 workers? For Ottawa, that would be close to 40,000 federal civil servants. So Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole was right all along, you can't mandate full vaccination. There has to be a fallback, such as regular testing.

OPINION: COVID or not -- Canada’s health-care system faces challenges,https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-covid-or-not-canadas-health-care-system-faces-challenges,torontosun.com,"Nineteen months into the COVID pandemic, Canada’s health-care system continues to face serious challenges, with hospitals in some provinces struggling with…","['Mackenzie Moir', 'Bacchus Barua']",2021-11-09 00:00:00,"Photo by CARLOS OSORIO / REUTERS Nineteen months into the COVID pandemic, Canada's health-care system continues to face serious challenges, with hospitals in some provinces struggling with overcrowded ICU's and staff burnout . The result? Despite progress in some quarters , elective surgeries are once again being postponed and non-COVID patients will have to wait for medically necessary care. While it may be tempting to blame our current challenges on COVID-19, our new study suggests the pandemic is exacerbating-but not causing-the systemic problems that plague our underperforming health-care system. The study compares the spending and performance of 28 countries with universal health care (on an age-adjusted basis) using 2019 data (the most recent year of comparable available data from the OECD). In line with previous findings, we find that while Canada ranked as the second-highest spender (at 11.3 per cent of GDP) among its comparators, its performance on several key metrics was mediocre to poor. For example, medical resources-on a per-person basis in 2019, Canada ranked 25 th out of 26 countries for acute care beds (2.0 beds per 1,000 population). By contrast, the highest-ranking country, South Korea, had 8.0 beds per 1,000 population. Unfortunately, beds aren't the only major resource Canada lacks, relative to other countries. The availability of medical personnel tells a similar story. In 2019, we had 2.8 physicians per 1,000 population, ranking 26 th out of 28 countries. This was a far cry from countries such as Austria (5.3) and Norway (5.2). And crucially, Canada also ranked near the bottom for the relative availability of MRI machines (21 st out of 24) and CT scanners (22 nd out of 26). When we consider these facts together, Canada's long wait times for health care become less of a mystery. Indeed, the Commonwealth Fund's latest international survey of the general population reveals that in 2020, Canada ranked dead last (10 th out of 10) for wait times to see a specialist and receive elective surgery. Additionally, far more Dutch (69 per cent) and Swiss (68 per cent) participants reported waiting less than four weeks to see a specialist than Canadians (38 per cent). And for elective surgery, 99 per cent of Germans and 90 per cent of French citizens reported waiting less than four months versus 62 per cent of Canadians. While the pandemic has obviously affected some of these wait times, older data tell the same story . Our health-care system struggled long before the pandemic-again, despite consistently being a top spender. But the news this year isn't all bad. Canada performed better than the average universal health-care country on survival rates for heart attacks (ranking 9 th out of 27), breast cancer (5 th out of 26) and rectal cancer (6 th out of 26) despite the relative shortage of resources and long wait times. Indeed, these serve more as a testament to our health-care workers than to our resource-deficient system. The past 19 months have pushed provincial health-care systems, and those who work in them, to their limits. Unfortunately, the ""new normal"" of endless hospital stress testing, scarce resources, surgical postponements and lengthening wait times is not much different from the ""old normal"" before the pandemic. Other countries have built health-care systems that demonstrably perform better at a comparable or lower cost. We should learn from them, enact new polices, reform the elements of our universal system where reform is most needed, and forge a ""better normal"" in the post-pandemic world.

Often, such controversies see distinct generational differences in terms of opinion, with younger generations being more prone to progressive outlooks. Indeed, while each age group consists of its own internal spectrums of thought, after a brief informal survey of 13 young adults, it is apparent that those in their 20s generally support the use of masks to prevent the spread of the virus. Interestingly, it seems the most significant motivating factor among this demographic is to keep others safe. Facilitating a sense of comfort and safety in those around them, particularly the elderly, the immunocompromised, or those who might have a stronger fear of the virus, is a priority while thoughts of self-preservation and personal health come second. In addition to this empathetic perspective, many of the younger generation also feel it is their responsibility or social duty to help prevent the spread of the virus. A desire to avoid being responsible for infecting someone else (regardless of the unlikelihood in it resulting in severe illness or death) and the willingness to take on the responsibility of preventing transmission are two sides of the same coin. Other pro-mask considerations of those in their 20s include addressing the societal strains caused by the virus, such as the economic downturn and overloading the health-care system (as many places have). The extensive use of masks has reduced the seemingly ubiquitous economic strain, particularly for smaller or local businesses. Mask compliance has allowed more businesses that were previously shut down due to health concerns to reopen with relative safety, thus easing the economic strain. A similar logic is held in concern with the health-care system. The virus has placed greater stress on the system and the health-care professionals who work within it. Higher mask usage may help reduce this extra stress and help restore a relative balance between society and health care again. Indeed, the overall consensus of young adults is the more mask-wearing compliance, the more positive the effect on both the economy and the health-care system. If there was an overarching complaint by those young adults in support of mask usage, it would be a desire for more readily available, reliably-sourced information about masks, their particular effectiveness, and their relationship with the coronavirus. Demands, such as wearing masks, are more readily accepted by the general populace when clear and concise reasoning supports them. In opposition to these majority perspectives, some young adults feel that the mandates of mask-wearing, be it a company policy or a passed bylaw, as well as the popular personal choice to wear a mask, are over-reactionary. These perspectives often allude to concerns regarding rights and freedoms infringements, a desire for mask use to be a self-assessed choice, and a fear of societal pressures and conformity. Questions about whether the virus warrants such extensive mask use and a belief that it is an inaccurate reflection of the danger posed by COVID-19 are often at the root of this opinion. Regardless of their positions on the use of masks, something all young adults seem to agree on is people's freedom to wear a mask if they so desire. There is no criticism or hostility towards those who are pro-mask. More significantly, all across the spectrum of opinion regarding mask-wearing, those in their 20s are open to listening to others' thoughts and considering arguments outside their perspective. There is a desire to create an informed opinion and an acceptance in leaving room for discussion around an individual's particular perspective.

Forster, in his preface to Mulk Raj Anand's novel Untouchable, observed that no one ""however sympathetic, could have created the character of Bakha, because he would not have known enough about his troubles,"" I am reminded of the troubles international travellers are facing these days. The Canadian government has introduced some stricter measures for international travellers in order to curb another COVID-19 spike. Travellers must provide proof of a negative COVID-19 molecular test taken up to 72 hours before their scheduled departure time. Travellers, unless exempted, are required to reserve a government-authorized hotel for three nights prior to departure to Canada, take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival in Canada, stay in the government-authorized hotel while awaiting the results of the COVID-19 molecular test taken on arrival, pay for the cost of the hotel stay, as well as all associated costs for food, security, transportation and infection prevention and control measures. Opinion: ""Posh, Posh, Corona Coming!"": International travellers made to feel like untouchables Travellers must present proof of having reserved and prepaid for their accommodation through an app ArriveCAN. So far so good. I, as a matter of fact, had to rush to India to see my ailing 80-year-old mother who needed emergency hip replacement surgery. On my journey back to Canada, I strictly followed the rules, got a negative COVID-19 molecular test 48 hours before my scheduled departure. I kept a face shield and mask on my face during the 14-hour non-stop flight from New Delhi to Vancouver. Upon arrival at around 9 a.m., I was sent to a Vancouver hotel that charged $1,566 and denied breakfast and lunch because it was before official check-in at 4 p.m. I was helping a senior Punjabi couple with their logistics and both had diabetes, but they were denied breakfast and lunch too. After their long flight of 14 hours, two hours at the airport and now they are denied food for which they have spent a hefty amount. The menu is another interesting part of this story. For vegetarians, the hotel offered two samosas with chickpeas for breakfast and only one item for the lunch and dinner to be repeated for the next two days. If the result of the COVID-19 molecular test taken on arrival comes after 10 hours or so, the passengers leave for their homes, but the amount taken by the hotels is not refunded. They charge for the services they never provide. No hearing to this whatsoever. During the stay in the hotel, no employee enters the room for the cleanliness and change of sheets. They are treated as ""untouchables."" The passengers board the planes with proof of a negative COVID-19 molecular test, keep themselves behind masks every time during the flight, the crew has minimal contact with them. They are not allowed to walk in the isles of the plane; still, they are treated as if they carried the COVID-19 virus. At the airport, the staff doesn't speak, just signals to stay away. When Mulk Raj Anand wrote Untouchable , he drew out the pain of a young sweeper. A high caste man asks the protagonist, Bakha, ""Keep to the side of the road, you low-caste vermin! Why don't you call, you swine, and announce your approach! Do you know you have touched me and defiled me, you cockeyed son of a bow-legged scorpion! Now I will have to go and take a bath to purify myself. And it was a new dhoti and shirt I put on this morning!"" Every single person at the airport and at the hotel seemed high caste men and women who treated the passengers as such. In Untouchable, Bakha, the protagonist announces, ""Posh keep away, posh, sweeper coming, posh, posh, sweeper coming, posh, posh, sweeper coming!"" And we on the airport were seemingly announcing, ""Posh keep away, posh, Corona coming, posh, posh, corona coming…!"" A young adult, on a work permit in Canada, told me he had gone to attend the marriage of his only sister, another came back after the funeral of his father. A newly married lady was coming to unite with her family. None of them was a snowbird. None of them was carrying COVID-19, everyone was having a negative COVID-19 molecular test report. Yet, they were all treated differently. The questions raised above need answers. Will somebody come forward for that?

Opinion: Alberta mosques are setting a high bar in the COVID fight,https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-alberta-mosques-are-setting-a-high-bar-in-the-covid-fight,calgaryherald.com,"In the middle of May, towards the end of Ramadan, the province of Alberta entered Stage 1 of its relaunching strategy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. For…",['Calgary Herald'],2020-06-11 00:00:00,"Handout In the middle of May, towards the end of Ramadan, the province of Alberta entered Stage 1 of its relaunching strategy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. For Muslims who, for the first time in many of their lives, were praying at home and avoiding group fast-breaking meals, the reopening brought the opportunity to join a few communal prayers in Islam's holiest month, however different those prayers might appear due to distancing measures. Closely following and exceeding the government's regulations for the distanced gatherings, mosques belonging to the Muslim Association of Canada, in particular, have set the bar for safe, health-conscious worship. First at Rahma Masjid in Edmonton, MAC Islamic Centre Of Cold Lake and now at Al Salam Centre in Calgary, Albertan Muslims are demonstrating the very best practices for keeping worshippers safe while accessing much-needed spiritual and mental health resources - an example being followed in other parts of the country. The government of Alberta has set a standard for dealing with COVID-19 that is ahead of other provinces in many ways, and none more so than its approach to safely reopening houses of worship. Some might ask why a house of worship such as a mosque might be a top priority for a government relaunching. MAC mosques, such as Rahma and Al-Salam, are crucial centres for socially responsive programming focusing on charity, spiritual and mental health needs, and places of community belonging even in times of physical distancing. Mosque closures, while absolutely necessary for the preservation of life and safety at the beginning of the pandemic, meant that crucial funding and supportive programming ground to a halt, just as the need for them in the community rose exponentially. As a result of MAC's crucial social services and especially due to its well-developed national infrastructure for governance, which affords centralized adaptive responses to shifting community needs, MAC has been at the forefront of consultation with the province for reopenings as the need for total restriction has eased. With notable participation in several town hall meetings, as well as being directly consulted by the province on numerous occasions, MAC has built on its existing, non-partisan ties with the government to advocate for the best interests of Muslims and all Albertans. After a month at Stage 1, the province of Alberta has just expanded the limit from 50 people or one-third of regular service attendance to no cap on the number of people who can visit a place of worship, with proper physical distancing. The province has also set a number of guidelines for houses of worship that include but are not limited to using the COVID-19 self-assessment tool for all staff, visitors and congregants prior to attending; promoting COVID-19 prevention activities, procedures and education; and maintaining a single point of entry and a separate point of exit for all worship spaces. In consultation with Premier Jason Kenney, chief medical officer Dr. Deena Hinshaw and the minister of culture and multiculturalism, MAC has extended and expanded these guidelines specifically for mosques. For example, in typical communal prayer in Islam, group prayer takes place shoulder-to-shoulder; however, in the era of COVID-19, worshippers maintain two-metre spacing between them at all times by following markers on the floor and through the mandating that everyone bring their own prayer rugs. Further, to reduce the chances of airborne contamination, MAC has recommended masks for all participants and recitation of the prayers is mandated for the imam alone, facing away from congregants who are only permitted to repeat the prayers in their hearts, silently. Lastly, to protect our most vulnerable community members, a registration system has been rolled out at Edmonton's Rahma Mosque and congregational prayer has been disallowed for individuals with chronic medical conditions. Young children have also not been permitted to attend for worship due to uncertainty about their ability to maintain physical distancing and perform essential hygiene practices. As the largest Canadian Muslim organization with a national reach rooted in strong local chapters in 14 cities, MAC is in a unique position to standardize exceptional relaunching strategies across the country. The MAC Alberta example should serve as inspiration for other houses of worship and provinces working to reopen safely as we all navigate our new reality together.

Opinion: Healthcare workers need safe places to work,https://theprovince.com/opinion/op-ed/opinion-healthcare-workers-need-safe-places-to-work,theprovince.com,"Violent protests outside hospitals have given the public a view into the dangers that doctors and other health care professionals face. Sometimes it is the noise of demonstrators who prevent us from caring for patients. But sometimes it is more, such as the assault of a nurse in Quebec for giving a vaccination.","['Dr. Eric Cadesky', 'Dr. Cindy Lee', 'Dr. Ruchika Shukla']",2021-10-05 00:00:00,"Opinion: Healthcare appreciation such as the banging of pots and pans at the beginning of the pandemic has given way to the increasingly offensive behaviour that doctors and nurses experience now Photo by JONATHAN HAYWARD / THE CANADIAN PRESS With societal incivility worsening and COVID-19 exposing cracks in the health care system, those of us on the front lines are increasingly exposed to conflict as we try to help those who seek it. People feel anxious and stressed about the pandemic and take it out on us when they have to wait to be seen. Systemic disinformation campaigns have caused distrust in medical expertise; when asked to show proof of vaccination, some patients threaten our staff, or spit at us when asked to put on a mask. Several times we have had to call for police intervention when verbal assaults risked becoming physical. The trauma of the pandemic, the protests, and the risk of personal violence demoralizes us and our families. Burnout rates skyrocket and stress leaves are common, further stretching our resources. Some colleagues have chosen to retire while others are uncertain if they can continue working in unsafe spaces. So where is the will to protect health care workers? While some organizations such as Doctors of B.C. have published guides on workplace violence, a look at how the political parties approached health in the last election is telling. Platforms included increasing health transfers to provinces, implementing national pharmacare, adding mental health services, and hiring new doctors and nurses. And while these are all important, they do not address the current reality: Those of us still on the front lines are in danger. It is easier to protect our current health care workers than to recruit new ones; Quebec is even offering to pay nurses up to $18 000 to stay on the job. And with doctors, nurses, and other staff overwhelmed with patient care, governments and health authorities need to address this crisis by supporting clinic owners and managers to improve safety measures. Physical spaces can be made safer with panic buttons, electronic door locks, barriers at reception, and examination rooms that do not place patients between medical staff and exit doors. De-escalation techniques and self-defence training for staff should be offered. And while confidentiality may be cited as an issue, strategically placed security cameras like those already used in grocery and jewelry stores can help deter aggressive behaviour and assist the police after an incident. COVID-19 has exhausted us all. Healthcare appreciation such as the banging of pots and pans at the beginning of the pandemic has given way to the increasingly offensive behaviour that we experience now. We do our best as healers to work with patients at various stages of distress and have the right to terminate patient-doctor relationships if there is abuse; this does little to protect us from the immediate dangers that can quickly develop. With the pandemic still raging we need all of the human health care resources we have. Doctors and other health care workers can no longer work in such difficult environments and remain at risk of preventable injury - or worse. Despite the personal risks, we have pledged to continue working tirelessly for you - but in order for us to be there for you when needed most, let's all demand action to end working conditions that are hazardous to our health. Dr. Eric Cadesky, Dr. Amanda Lau, Dr. Angela Lee, Dr. Cindy Lee, Dr. Daniel Ngui, Dr. Julie Nguyen, Dr. Ruchika Shukla, and Dr. Arthur Vasquez are all community-based family doctors and clinic directors in Vancouver.

Opinion: The urgent need for widespread rapid testing,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-the-urgent-need-for-widespread-rapid-testing,nationalpost.com,We have the opportunity to virtually eliminate active infections this winter,"['Sandy White', 'Adam Singfield', 'David Juncker', 'Perrin Beatty', 'Special To National Post']",2021-02-02 00:00:00,"Photo by Amir MAKAR/AFP The following open letter arguing for the adoption of widespread rapid testing in Canada was signed by 28 members of the medical and business communities. As the second wave of the pandemic continues, infection rates and hospitalizations are rising in many parts of Canada. Both lives and livelihoods are tragically being lost each day. In a response that was previously unimaginable, many Canadians were prohibited from gathering to see friends and family over the holidays, and many businesses are again forced to close in an effort to stop the spread of the virus. In Quebec, a curfew has been put in place for the first time and Ontario has now implemented an unprecedented general stay-at-home order. While vaccinations have begun, we remain many months away from the majority of Canadians being immunized. As we wait, more lives are being lost, more livelihoods are being destroyed and the mountain of new debt - for individuals, businesses and governments - continues to grow. With countries like Australia , South Korea and others managing to control COVID-19, Canadians must ask themselves how much longer our patchwork approach is sustainable. In this crisis, rapid testing and contact tracing is a key public health tool that other nations have adopted. This strategy involves: using tests that deliver results in minutes to find positive cases and isolate them quickly; testing high-risk and asymptomatic individuals; implementing effective contact tracing to quickly identify those who may have been exposed to COVID-19, so they, too, can be rapidly tested; and supporting a layered approach, which includes maintaining physical distancing and protective measures like masks, hand-washing and new safety protocols in stores and workplaces. Frequent testing with antigen tests can be scaled up quickly, in order to detect contagiousness and help cut the chains of infection. Indeed, some countries have tested their entire populations in days using this approach, while others are launching campaigns to test millions daily. In contrast, Canada currently administers barely 70,000 daily PCR tests, which deliver results in days, rather than minutes. The traditional PCR tests Canada is currently using are highly sensitive, identifying the virus before, during and after someone is transmitting it, and will remain the bedrock of medical diagnosis. They are, however, inadequate as a widespread public health tool to curb a fast-moving and prevalent virus. They are also expensive, and hence are being used sparingly. They could in fact be better utilized to confirm positive test results from rapid antigen testing programs than as the first line of defence. A study from Harvard University provides a blueprint for how rapid testing could contribute to the suppression of COVID-19 in weeks, stating : ""when it comes to public health, it's better to have a less sensitive test with results today than a more sensitive one with results tomorrow."" Our group, Rapid Test and Trace Canada , estimates that, for roughly $2 billion, Canada could quickly achieve testing levels of 200,000 people per day, while working towards testing five million people daily by April. This would allow us to virtually eliminate active infections this winter, while vaccines are being rolled out to provide long-term protection. Nothing we are proposing is ground-breaking - it is already being done elsewhere. Further, the tests are already in Canada, approved and ready to be deployed. While some small pilots are under way, why isn't this key technology being utilized to the maximum extent possible? Nearly a year into the pandemic, a great deal of work still needs to be done to develop a comprehensive testing strategy for seniors homes, hard-hit lower income and minority groups, Indigenous communities and even the general population. Many Canadian businesses are now undertaking to test their employees at significant cost, stepping up to fill the need. Because governments and health services are stretched so thin, activating Canada's business community is the best way to quickly reach as many Canadians as possible with rapid tests to alleviate some of the strain on our health-care system. In the worst crisis since the Second World War, we are fighting with one hand tied behind our backs. Deploying rapid testing on a wide scale and allowing Canadian business to assist in this effort is of critical importance as part of a layered approach to combating COVID-19. To advance the effort, Canada needs to commit capital and resources to rapid testing and begin to approve the use of low-cost rapid at-home tests. In the near future, Canadians would be able to administer tests themselves without the barriers involved with the authorized, rapid antigen tests that require a health professional to administer them. The urgency cannot be overstated. Widespread vaccination of our country is many months away, with worrying supply concerns, while the real harm of the virus continues to be felt every day. The widespread use of rapid testing and enhanced contact tracing can play a significant, positive role in the fight against COVID-19. Canadian governments at all levels have significant ground to make up on this front. In this effort, we all must be part of the solution and bring all resources to bear. The faster we contain and control the virus, the faster we will be able to save lives and safely reopen our society.
