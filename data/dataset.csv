"Economic Underperformance, Excessive Indebtedness, and Our Constrained Future",https://www.macvw.ca/research/2020/9/9/economic-underperformance-excessive-indebtedness-and-our-constrained-future,www.macvw.ca,,['Kari Lancaster'],2020-07-25 12:46:00,"With last week’s federal deficit announcement, it is now more important than ever that we acknowledge our current realities with detail and clarity. We otherwise will be unable to develop a believable and effective path forward in the post-COVID world. The problem is that our current realities are uncomfortably negative. Many of us just don’t want to see this or believe it. We were in a slow-moving crisis of competitiveness, investment, and productivity prior to the COVID lockdown. Now, we have both stagnant productivity and excessive levels of debt. This feels negative as most of us understandably want to feel positive and optimistic about our future. However, for optimism to be real it must be grounded in reality. It is only then we can develop a believable and inspiring vision, and the appropriate strategies to recover and rebuild our economy.
Prior to the COVID lockdown, the economic fundamentals in Canada were already grim:
As a Canadian, if you were fortunate enough to accumulate savings, the last thing you should have done is to invest in Canadian companies on Canadian stock exchanges.
We were in a state of investment, competitive, and economic underperformance before the pandemic-related collapse. “Going back to normal” or “the way things were” is going back to a set of conditions that were compromising the future for all Canadians.
And now, we have the added reality of excessive debt. The inevitable consequence is a loss of financial flexibility, less capacity to spend, and more financial risk in the event of an extended recession, additional intermittent lockdowns, or some other new, unforeseen crisis.
Although the financial position of our federal government was reasonable going into the COVID lockdown (debt to GDP ratio was 35%), this has all changed seemingly overnight.
With a $350 billion deficit, we are now adding about 15% to the debt to GDP ratio. Maybe this still doesn’t look too alarming, however, we are missing a large part of the picture if we ignore the provinces.
We have learned in crisis that the national government will be called upon to backstop the credit demands of all provinces, and to a certain extent, even corporate and household debt.
Ontario’s debt is now about $400 billion, Quebec $200 billion, and then there are the other provinces. The Western provinces, including Manitoba, are now close to approximately $150 billion. The Atlantic provinces represent another $50 billion in debt. If you’re keeping track, that’s $800 billion of provincial debt combined with now over $1 trillion of federal debt. Total “all in” government debt is now at least $1.8 trillion and heading towards $2.0 trillion which would be 100% of GDP – that represents over $50,000 for every man woman and child in Canada, or $200,000 for a household of four.
Analysts and economists tend to look at debt solely on the basis of decision-making authority and responsibility at the entity level, as this is where insolvency would occur. This is why most don’t aggregate debt. But aside from insolvency risk, the key problem with debt that’s often overlooked is how it constrains choice and optionality. The aggregation of choice and commitment drives our overall economy. Understanding our economic outlook requires accounting for the burden of debt across all decision-making entities.
The government debt described above is layered on top of consumer and corporate debt. Total consumer debt in Canada is at a record $2.3 trillion which includes $1.6 trillion of mortgages. Household debt to disposable income is now at a record high of 181%.
Corporate debt in Canada is also at record levels of about $2.4 trillion and based on the Bank of International Settlements, our corporate debt service ratio is among the highest in the world.
Total household, corporate, and government debt is about $7.0 trillion. This is 350% on a $2 trillion economy.
The one thing we know about debt is that if you can survive through a downturn, it will constrain choice; it will constrain the scope and flexibility of decision-making commitments. This will be the new reality for many decision makers across the entire economy.
You can reasonably expect that consumers and corporations will be spending less and repairing balance sheets, and governments at all levels will be forced to be more accountable and discerning in spending and borrowing. All of this will likely be a net drag on the economy for years.
Unfortunately, this is all happening at the same time that Canada’s GDP per capita and labour productivity have been lagging.
The issue of productivity must be emphasized. To quote Nobel Laureate economist, Paul Krugman:
“Productivity isn’t everything, but in the long run it is almost everything. A country’s ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise output per worker.”
Canada is now in an era of both stagnating productivity, low competitiveness, and excessive levels of indebtedness. In the corporate investment world, we often describe this as a “strategic straightjacket” – with less choice and less freedom to move. All of this should encourage a reset in priorities towards fiscal constraint, incentivizing investment, and pursuing more business-friendly policies and strategies that will tilt towards increasing innovation, productivity, and prosperity."

Article content The last months have been filled with bleak predictions about mental health in Canada due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These predictions have been couched in apocalyptic language, with much talk of a looming “mental health crisis,” “depression time-bomb” or even an “epidemic of suicide.” Such forecasts predict an imminent mental health disaster across Canada, with worse consequences than the coronavirus pandemic itself.

Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: Pandemic's impact on mental health might surprise us Back to video A just released Léger survey of more than 1,500 adult Canadians give some preliminary answers. This survey found that only 16 per cent of Canadians rate their mental health as “bad” or “very bad” since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. In other words, the vast majority rate their mental health as “good,” “very good” or “excellent,”despite rising concerns about a second wave and further lockdowns. These findings are consistent with pre-existing research indicating that socio-economic crises can (counter-intuitively) actually promote mental health. For example, the phrase “Blitz spirit” is well-known in the United Kingdom, referring to a semi-mythical period of the Second World War, where Londoners rallied together with resolution and defiance to resist the ravages of nightly Luftwaffe air-raids. This “Blitz spirit” is epitomized in a famous British wartime poster Keep Calm and Carry On.

Article content While some have questioned the reality of the “Blitz spirit,” research shows that psychiatric admissions actually decreased during the Blitz. Moreover, a network of psychiatric clinics that were set up to cater for the expected mental health casualties of the Blitz were closed due to a lack of patients, indicating that the Luftwaffe raids did not trigger an epidemic of mental illness. More recently, a large-scale European study surprisingly found an overall decrease in depressive symptoms after the Global Financial Crisis across 19 of the 21 countries studied (Spain and Cyprus being the exceptions). These findings imply that the repercussions of the Global Financial Crisis were not uniformly negative, and that doomsday predictions about an impending mental health crisis due to COVID-19 may not be warranted.

Article content These findings raise the question: What factors promote mental health during a socio-economic crisis such as COVID-19? The existing research points to some surprising answers. First, work is a source of purpose and meaning for most people, but can also engender significant amounts of stress. The “work from home” directives associated with COVID-19 will have provided a welcome break from a stressful work environment for many, as well as less time commuting and more quality time with immediate family, all of which has been linked to positive mental health. Second, research indicates that people tend to cut back on unhealthy habits such as smoking, drinking and junk food during socio-economic crises, often as a cost-cutting measure. Contrariwise, people are more likely to exercise outdoors and obtain adequate sleep due to reduced traffic, which can also mean less pollution and fewer accidents. All this can improve physical health, which is inextricably linked to mental health.

Article content Third, crises such as COVID-19 can engender their own type of “Blitz spirit,” uniting people in a collective experience and common cause. Indeed, a Hong Kong study found that the SARS crisis engendered widespread increases in social support from family and friends, as well as increased attention to mental health issues per se across society. To be sure, COVID-19 has created considerable anxiety and insecurity across Canada, and support and resources should be available for those in need. But apocalyptic visions of a looming mental health crisis may be erroneously alarmist. For some, the ongoing crisis will cause mental health woes, particularly the newly unemployed and those in financial difficulties. But for others, it may provide a much-needed breathing space and an opportunity to rethink priorities.

Article content The people of northwestern Ontario are getting an extra-special Christmas present from the province this year — a 14-day lockdown. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. OPINION: No need for lockdown in northwest Back to video The lockdown puts the Northwestern Health Unit, among the other health units in northern Ontario, into the grey zone for two weeks starting on Boxing Day. Media reports over the weekend said the lockdown was to start on Dec. 24, but apparently the dire situation Ontario is in can wait five days. We have it better up here than our southern Ontario counterparts, who will enter into a 28-day lockdown. This seems like a good idea in the south where case numbers are rising and hospitals are reaching capacity. Although, Dr. Adalsteinn Brown, a member of the premier’s COVID-19 table, said on Monday that any lockdown less than four weeks isn’t effective. So what is a two-week lockdown going to do exactly? What we’ve been doing to prevent the spread of COVID-19 has worked thus far in the northwest. We’ve followed the public health advice, we’ve washed our hands, we’ve stayed home when we’re sick and we’ve worn masks in enclosed public spaces. Why are we being punished for what is going down south? Now, health officials have said that the Christmas holidays could bring more cases as people will gather in their homes, even if they shouldn’t. But how is that any different than Thanksgiving, or Halloween, or Canada Day? We never saw a significant spike in the northwest after those holidays. Sure, there was a small spike after Thanksgiving, but it wasn’t bad and our hospitals weren’t overrun.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content We did move into the “Yellow” zone under the province’s pandemic response framework in November, but our case counts have plummeted since then. A move to “Green” should’ve been on the cards, but instead, we are being shoved into our homes and business owners will have to shelf their Boxing Day sales as curbside pickup will be the only option to collect revenue. The ironic thing is, under the current restrictions, you can have a gathering of 10 people in your home, so Christmas is not even close to being cancelled. In fact, it’s being enabled. But Boxing Day shopping? Not allowed. Are you scratching your head, too? January tends to be a slower month as people are recovering from the holiday hangover, and the end of December is an opportunity for retailers to cash in on people’s padded Christmas wallets.
The province is offering a grant to businesses, but how much will that help? To boot, ski hills are not allowed to open so Mount Evergreen won’t be able to operate when kids are out of school. Premier Doug Ford said during his daily press conference on Dec. 21 that he knows what it’s like to be a business owner. But does he know what it’s like to be a northerner? Queen’s Park needs to stop forgetting there are people who live, work and play up here in the northwest. Somehow being located next to Winnipeg, one of Canada’s COVID-19 hotspots, we’ve kept our case counts low. Will this lockdown in the northwest send people to Winnipeg to shop? Who knows, the lockdowns in Manitoba certainly brought Manitobans here, it hasn’t been an uncommon sight to see Manitoban plates roaming Kenora.

Article content It is still not cool to demonize Manitobans, by the way. Should they be here? Probably not, but you shouldn’t be in Manitoba unless absolutely necessary. It’s a two-way street. Ontario could also extend this lockdown, as they’ve introduced legislation to enable themselves to do that. So who knows how long it will last? Alas, we must deal with the cards we’re dealt, so it’s into isolation we go on Boxing Day. The silver lining is we live in the most beautiful part of the world to social distance outside. Take the time to go ice fishing, fire up the woodstove at camp, go for a hike or support a local restaurant and have a takeout movie night. These two weeks will hopefully fly by and we can get back to where we were before.

Looking to buy a car soon? Auto sales are in for a bumpy ride as coronavirus spreads,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/drive/mobility/article-looking-to-buy-a-car-soon-auto-sales-are-in-for-a-bumpy-ride-as/,www.theglobeandmail.com,"Opinions are mixed and divided by country on how the coronavirus outbreak will affect production and parts suppliers, and when factories will be up and running",['Mark Richardson'],2020-03-13 05:00:00,"The COVID-19 pandemic is now everywhere, moving more rapidly than most in North America imagined. Who knows where it’s all headed? Large gatherings are cancelled and workers are encouraged to stay home, some in self-quarantine.
It’s not so simple for workers in assembly plants to stay home, however, and nor for salespeople and technicians at auto dealerships. If those hands-on people want to continue to make money, despite government assurances of financial assistance, they have to be there on the shop floor, masks and sanitizer within reach. The only solution may be a forced closure of the entire facility.
This happened a week ago in Windsor, where the FCA minivan plant stopped production of the Chrysler Pacifica for 24 hours after unionized workers walked out, concerned for their health after a co-worker self-quarantined.
In Europe, Renault, Peugeot, Ford and Volkswagen, among others, have shut down auto assembly plants for the foreseeable future. In Italy, non-essential businesses are ordered closed, and of course that includes car dealerships. We’ve not seen such a ripple of closures in North America yet, but it may well happen soon and it doesn’t bode well for either auto production or sales.
All businesses will say their decision to close will be made in the interest of public health and safety, but it will really come down to supply and demand. Both General Motors and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said this month that their U.S. production has not been affected, and GM’s CEO Mary Barra said earlier in March that parts supplies are assured “quite far into this month” – an optimistic translation of that statement suggests only another week or so, however, compared to the usual one or two months.
Parts production is being restored slowly in Central China, but these production lines need their own suppliers; this does not happen overnight. “Even if we wanted to resume production, we can’t access the materials we need due to supply chain disruptions,” a spokesperson for a Japanese auto supply company with plants in four Central Chinese cities told Reuters. “On top of that, we’re facing staffing shortages at our plants.”
Ontario-based Magna International, the world’s third largest manufacturer of auto parts, said Sunday that production has resumed at most of its 54 plants in China, though not yet to full capacity. And parts maker Martinrea International Inc., also based in Ontario, said this month that shifting dependence to locally manufactured parts, even at potentially higher cost, could be a good thing.
“Longer term, I believe the coronavirus event coupled with the trade disputes we have seen may cause all of us to review our supply chains,” said Rob Wildeboer, executive chair of Martinrea, on a quarterly conference call with investors March 5.
“For example, I think this will add to a trend to local insourcing or restoring to North America, which frankly could be very good for us.”
In Mexico, however, a government minister admitted that some auto assembly plants have enough inventory only for this month. Unlike Barra, he thought this was a major concern.
“I’ve been in contact with some important companies,” Manuel Gonzalez told Reuters. He’s the economic development minister for Aguascalientes, one of a dozen Mexican states that produce cars, of which 80 per cent go to the United States and Canada. “If that supply is not normalized, we will probably see firms suspending production.”
Even if the supply is restored, however, the buyers may not be there. Last week, Morgan Stanley said in an investor note that it expects U.S. auto sales to drop by 9 per cent this year, compared to the 1-2 per cent it originally forecast. That’s a drop of a million new vehicles from its initial estimate of 16.5 million vehicles to be sold in 2020. It won’t be just new cars affected, either, thanks to what Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas called the “demand shock” of COVID-19. “Lower consumer sentiment will mean consumers may put off the purchase of expensive consumer discretionary purchases such as a ~$35k new car,” wrote Jonas to justify his prediction.
Research company LMC Automotive is not quite so gloomy, saying that U.S. sales will probably only drop an additional 300,000 this year, but its current forecast for the world as a whole is still not optimistic, dropping about 4 per cent for all auto sales. After all, sales in China plummeted almost 80 per cent in February, where whole cities have been on lockdown.
“Forecasts for car markets are likely to be revised down as the public health crisis deepens - especially in Europe and North America,” says David Leggett, Automotive Editor for analytics company GlobalData.
“If the global vehicle market decline in 2020 is nearer 10 per cent, that will inevitably result in much lower earnings for automotive companies, many of whom are experiencing rising cost pressures formed by the necessity to invest in expensive technologies such as electrification. Indeed, the new stronger headwinds on the global car market come as they face the burden of much tighter regulatory hurdles on CO2, especially in Europe.”
There is one sign of hope, however. Gas prices are significantly down, now averaging 82 cents a litre in southern Ontario. With people avoiding the congestion of public transport, and perhaps less frugal with using their cars, maybe we’ll all rediscover the joy of driving. After all, what goes around, comes around.

Article content As the CEO of GlaxoSmithKline Canada (GSK) for 16 years, now retired for nine, I was deeply involved in the production and distribution of the Canadian vaccine for the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, working collaboratively with public health and other government officials. All the vaccine for that pandemic was produced in the GSK factory in Quebec City. The campaign, after a few initial snags, was a tremendous success. The vaccine was developed, rolled out and injected into millions of Canadians in just several months.

Article content I felt compelled to write about the current vaccine supply situation when federal Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs Dominic Leblanc erroneously stated on CTV’s Power Play that we don’t have any domestic vaccine production in Canada because “GSK closed its facility during the Harper years.” In fact, that facility is still operational and manufactures much of Canada’s annual flu vaccine.

This is surprising considering Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has consistently stated that “We are better on vaccines than just about every other country.” The provinces have worked out their logistics issues and are not the problem. The problem is clearly that the federal government is not able to procure significant doses of vaccine until April. Canada will receive 1.2 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccine by the end of January and six million doses by the end of March. That will allow the vaccination of approximately three million citizens — less than 10 per cent of the population. Many other countries have received significantly more vaccine on a population-adjusted basis. The question is: Why is Canada not able to acquire more vaccine early?

Article content Not surprisingly, the industry has gone elsewhere to invest — to places like the U.K., the U.S. and the EU where that positive environment does exist. They are all performing better than Canada on early vaccine acquisition. A senior public health official in Israel recently stated that one of the reasons that country was able to acquire large quantities of doses was its good relationship with the pharmaceutical industry. This unfavourable environment has its roots in the Trudeau government of 1968 and the effective elimination of pharmaceutical patents. That lead to the hollowing-out of the innovative industry and the emergence of a generic-company oligopoly that was supported by successive Liberal governments.

Article content The Mulroney and Harper governments supported the innovative industry by improving the patent landscape but Canada only partially recovered and to this day does not have globally competitive patent protection. The negative trend continues even now with the imminent implementation of a punitive pricing regime through new federal (Patented Medicine Price Review Board) regulations. One now has to ask: where are the generic companies when we badly need innovation? Liberal government pharmaceutical policy has failed Canadians at our time of greatest need. Is Canada unable to acquire early vaccines because the federal government was late negotiating contracts with companies as it attempted to acquire domestic supply by funding three or four opportunities, including collaboration on the CanSino vaccine from China, that frankly had virtually no chance of succeeding? Or is it because Canada may not have been willing to pay a per-dose price that would have ensured significant early supply?

Article content Or, finally, is our initial supply small because Canada provided little to no funding for the development of the vaccines, unlike the contributions made by the U.S., U.K. and Germany? Operation Warp Speed in the U.S. contributed $12 billion to support accelerated development and manufacturing. It should be no surprise that the U.S. now has large quantities of vaccine. When it comes to vaccine supply Canada should be in the same position as these other leading countries. Instead, we are three to four months behind. How many more people will die in this pandemic who wouldn’t have if the federal government had done a better job acquiring more early doses? How many more businesses will fail? How long will the lockdowns go on? Months matter in this struggle. Days matter. Unfortunately, Canadians are paying a steep price.

Article content Moving forward, Canada should start preparing for the inevitable next pandemic by establishing a constructive partnership between the federal government and the innovative pharmaceutical/life sciences industry. Canada needs to position the sector as one of our strategic industries — which, incredibly, it currently is not. The government needs to build a policy platform that will make Canada globally competitive in attracting innovation and investment. Part of that investment has to be domestic pandemic vaccine manufacturing capability. There should be no excuses next time.

Article content In early 2020, asymptomatic transmission was suspected to pose a risk large enough to respond to the novel coronavirus with unprecedented lockdowns and mobility restrictions. Normally, any important government policy is subject to a cost-benefit analysis – why was this not done for the COVID-19 measures? Independent Canadian researchers predict a devastating toll: one study estimates that 5-10 times more life is lost due to lockdowns (measured in years of life lost prematurely, i.e. Canadians dying earlier than they would without lockdowns), as compared to any lives that may have been saved, and another study pegs the costs at up to 282 times greater than the benefits. The collateral damage of lockdowns on our emotional, physical, and mental health is increasingly coming to light. And so is the impact of mobility restrictions on the fabric of society: for more than one year, we have been encouraged to refrain from regular social contact and to perceive those around us as carriers of disease and death. Considering that humans are social beings, this is an unprecedented experiment that might have devastating long-term effects, especially on children.

California imposed full dining closures and stay-at-home mandates in November-December 2020, whereas Florida had lifted most restrictions as early as September 2020. Despite California’s strict measures, the daily death counts attributed to COVID19 continued to rise during the third wave and peaked in January-February 2021. A similar rise was seen in Florida but the peak level was lower than for California, followed by a steady decrease. Florida has done remarkably well, health-wise and economically, throughout the pandemic and that with a population more than half that of Canada squeezed into a landmass similar to Nova Scotia.

Article content In long-term care family presence is critical. This is even more evident during a pandemic. The Saskatchewan Health Authority’s policy for family presence to support compassionate care in LTC is applied to “residents in long term care (LTC) and special care homes where it is determined that the resident’s quality of life and/or care needs cannot be met without the assistance of a family member or support person.”

Article content Quality of life is very broad. It extends beyond basic health and personal care needs, such as helping someone eat or get dressed and includes psychological, emotional and social needs. These needs can be difficult or impossible for staff to meet on their own and are critical for the health and well-being of residents. The policy names specific situations that indicate unmet needs, including physical and/or mental health decline, a significant change in family presence since the pandemic began, and poor ability to participate meaningfully in virtual or outdoor visitations.

Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: Consider essential visitations to long-term care homes Back to video It is the resident or the family member/support person who determine if quality of care and/or care needs cannot be met without the assistance of a designated family member or support person in collaboration with the care team. Unfortunately, the public and some LTC administrators have come to mistakenly understand that the policy restricts all visiting in LTC except end-of-life care. Despite clear policies defining criteria for safe family presence, more limiting restrictions have been implemented in many LTC homes to control and limit family presence. The misinterpretations continue to create hardship and distress for so many, at an already challenging time in this pandemic. It is true that limits and restrictions are necessary to control risk during a pandemic, and that one person’s well-being should not be pitted against another’s. The SHA’s family presence policy does address this. For example, family members need to follow screening and infection control practices.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content Strict ‘no visitor’ policies were implemented early in the pandemic when less was known about COVID-19 presentation and transmission. There was limited access to testing, and homes were scaling up infection prevention and control approaches, and personal protective equipment access. These deficiencies have been addressed now and there has been a shift in visitor policy across Canada and globally to reduce the detrimental effects of prolonged lockdowns on residents, families, and staff. There is growing evidence that locking families out results in physical and psychosocial harm to residents, families, and staff. It must be acknowledged that each person and family have their own level of risk tolerance. Some families have found virtual connections work well and keep them and their own community contacts safe and satisfied. Some do not want to take the chance of taking COVID-19 into the care setting. Some are practising physical distancing rigorously to protect their own health. Provinces in Canada have moved to support safe, but limited family presence. Saskatchewan can keep pace with the full implementation of the current SHA policy. Across the continuum of care, group homes, personal care homes, and LTC homes (including those owned by or affiliated with SHA) should be supported and accountable to consistently apply SHA policy. As the long months of the pandemic continue, we must move quickly to reunite families and LTC residents. We have a great deal to gain since much of the care provided in Canadian LTC homes is normally provided by families. Permitting families to resume their caregiving roles has potential to increase resident quality of life, reduce excess mortality due to social isolation, prevent residents from dying in the absence of family, and reduce the moral distress and work-related burden LTC staff are carrying when they feel they must try to “replace” the love and attention of family members, knowing this is neither morally nor physically possible.

Article content We do not call for opening the doors of LTC widely to all visitors at a time when community risk is high. We call instead for the implementation of the existing SHA policy to support residents and care teams in LTC. We must always accept family presence as an essential element of quality of life in LTC.

Article content Albertans are stepping forward and getting vaccinated. We are being rightfully rewarded with daily case rates of five per cent what they were weeks ago, and with the relaxation of health guidelines that will allow us to fully enjoy the summer. After such a long and burdensome year and a half of fear, restrictions and loss, this is very welcome news.

Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: Here's a three-step plan to fend off a potential new wave and further lockdowns Back to video No one knows for sure, but considering the global state of vaccinations, virus cases, variants and waves, it would at least be prudent to be prepared for more cases. Even if it is a slim chance of another wave, what are the downsides to planning over the summer? It is time to take what has been learned across the globe and prepare the best plan in the event of another wave — or waves — coming our way. To address the falsely presented dichotomy of economics versus health, we have collaborated to suggest a path forward that respects our society’s public health and economic needs. Here is our three-step plan for the province to follow, starting right now.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content Firstly, vaccinations are the best protection against further waves. Canada has among the highest rates of vaccination in the world when it comes to first doses, but we must not stop until every single person, including children, is vaccinated. This is by far our best defence against COVID and its variants, and we must not waiver in pressing for everyone to be protected. Businesses and public institutions need to implement incentives to encourage the full vaccination of employees and stakeholders. At the first hint of a new wave, we encourage all businesses and public institutions to limit in-person access to only those who are vaccinated. Why should we all suffer in lockdowns when most of us have been responsible by getting the vaccine? Why should businesses have to close because a small minority of people have not taken the responsible action of being vaccinated?
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content Some will ask, “what about those who cannot get vaccinated?” From a medical perspective, this is an exceedingly tiny group, at the very most it will be a very small sliver of the population. Choosing not to get vaccinated is a personal choice, and that is fine. But, there should be consequences for those who choose not to get vaccinated, not for the rest of us who are doing our part by getting vaccinated as an important contribution to overall public health. With an adequate supply of vaccines, there are almost no valid reasons left to not be vaccinated. Secondly, we need to be much more sophisticated in understanding and addressing the stealth nature of the COVID virus. This virus has three distinctive challenges: it is highly contagious (with variants being even more contagious), it transfers through people without necessarily showing itself (i.e. asymptomatic patients), and it is deadly. Now is the time to stockpile and develop protocol and training for massive distribution of rapid tests so if another wave hits, we can use the U.K. at-home test system to allow people to know immediately if they have contracted COVID, allow for quick contact tracing to stop the spread, and isolate only those who pose a risk to others. After 18 months, less than one per cent of Canadians have contracted COVID, but we continue to feel our only tool is a 100 per cent lockdown that harms all. It is time to smarten up.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content The third thing we need to do is support others around the world to have access to vaccines, and to take vaccines as the strongest means to combat COVID. In Canada, we have one of the highest adoption rates of vaccines (first dose, but growing in second doses), but we are constantly at risk as the virus transmits globally. COVID has shown itself as appearing, then retracting in waves. We are entering a low point in the wave. No one knows for sure if a new wave will crest, but why wait until we are once again scrambling to get on top of the situation? Now is the time to fully prepare with a new battle plan for the next wave.

Article content As a second wave of COVID-19 sweeps across Canada and the high tide of a first wave continues to inundate the U.S., a seemingly exasperated Dr. Theresa Tam and Dr. Anthony Fauci continue to remind North Americans to wear masks. Which begs the question, given all the evidence, and the mounting numbers of dead and hospitalized, why are some people still not wearing masks? We apologize, but this video has failed to load.
tap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: Make mask-wearing a sign of personal strength, not weakness. Lives depend on it Back to video The answer is that this is a problem of communication and persuasion, something that Tam and Fauci, despite their medical knowledge and skill, are ill-equipped to solve. Here’s the difficulty: Masks work to prevent the spread of the virus and we have the data to prove it. Tam and Fauci believe that if they just give the public this information, then their jobs are done. But information doesn’t motivate action, and the transmission of information doesn’t accurately describe how communication or persuasion work.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content Communication is a process of making meaning, and persuasion is the strategic art of assigning meaning for the purpose of motivating action. Any time we introduce a new idea or object into our public culture, we have a contest over the meaning of the idea or object. This contest over meaning is inevitable. Let’s consider helmets in hockey: For years hockey players thought helmets were a sign of weakness, misaligned with the general belief that hockey players were supposed to be macho and tough. The NHL had to fight this meaning in order to motivate players to wear helmets. Now very few people see helmets as a sign of weakness. This contest over meaning is inevitable In the case of the mask, we are living through a contest over what the mask means. For some, the mask means weakness, femininity, governmental overreach, or an infringement on personal freedom. A Fox News host tweeted: “Might as well carry a purse with that mask Joe” about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. Clearly this is an attempt to equate mask-wearing with weakness or femininity.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content It’s called semiotic tying, when we associate one object (the mask) with another (the purse) in order to suggest that people should relate the meaning of one to the other. This is how communication and persuasion work. President Donald Trump clearly believes masks mean weakness, which is why he so often refuses to wear one. The Trump administration has tried, since the beginning of the pandemic, to strategically tie mask-wearing to weakness by suggesting that someone who wears a mask is not tough enough to take on the virus. If you explore right-wing media for a few moments, you’ll find the communicative labour of tying weakness to mask-wearing and government oppression to masks. Meaning motivates action, information doesn’t. The statistics we receive about COVID-19 infections will not change behaviour. Drs. Tam and Fauci want us to see masks as necessary instruments of public health. For masks to work though, we need to be motivated to wear them because of what they mean. To achieve that, we need skilled communicators to tie the meaning of mask-wearing to values that can motivate action. Instead, Tam and Fauci like to tell us what function the masks serve (that they prevent the spread of aerosolized virus from our mouths and noses). But every time they do that is a missed opportunity to participate in the contest over meaning. If we do wear a mask because of the information we get from these doctors, it’s likely because we trust science and we’ve assigned meaningful values to science more generally. Or we do the labour ourselves of associating masks with other kinds of health and safety measures.

Article content Photo by Gavin Young/Postmedia News Those who reject mask wearing are motivated by the affective feeling of toughness derived from the kinds of associations Trump and others forge. But our government has not offered a competing, patriotic, uplifting set of associations that would motivate action in the same way. We have the slogan “we’re all in this together,” but that slogan remains unconnected to mask-wearing and is far too generic and vague. Canada Health and the CDC can transmit as much information as they want, but that information is unlikely to produce the effects necessary to motivate action. People make decisions, who to vote for or whether to wear a mask, not based on reasonable calculations or rational deliberation. In other words, people don’t think to themselves that the mask will lower their probability of getting the virus and therefore wearing one is the right thing to do. People need to be motivated to act, which requires a feeling driven by a value that derives from the meanings we associate with masks.

Article content Lives depend on the outcome of the contest over the meaning of the mask. It would be nice if Canada or the U.S. had a communication strategy that took the project of persuasion seriously, or at least understood that transmitting information was not all we need to do to motivate action. What we need now is to make mask-wearing a sign of respect, civility and patriotism. Returning our lives to normal may depend on that just as much as it depends on a vaccine.

Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: Political leadership needed now to tame the virus Back to video We’ve had eight months to learn how to control this pandemic. That the curve we worked so hard to flatten is now rising sharply means we must demand decisive action from our government. There is no time left to wait. Getting ahead of the virus Further delay in responding would be catastrophic. Because of the time it takes for someone to develop symptoms and get tested, the number of cases being reported today tells us less about what is going on now than about what was going on a week or more ago. Rising cases now means rising hospitalizations within a few weeks. It is hard to stay ahead of this virus. But experiences from other countries show us that the best strategy is to be proactive. In response to the recent alarming rise in cases, our provincial government finally announced a few new measures in late October and early November. Unfortunately, these public health-political actions are too little, too late. The mask mandate must be provincewide. Outside the three cities, some areas have active cases three to four times higher than in Saskatoon or Regina; for example, North Central where the per capita rate of COVID infections is the highest. Provinces like Nova Scotia and Newfoundland implemented mask mandates months earlier and now have the pandemic much more under control. Researchers have estimated that if mask mandates had been adopted across Canada in early July, the total cases per week could have been reduced by 700 to 1,100. Being proactive works.

Article content On Oct. 16, our provincial medical health officer said case numbers would have to rise to 60 per day before new restrictions were implemented. From Nov. 5 to 9, we’ve seen more than twice that number of new daily cases on average. What is the government waiting for? Learning from our neighbours We do not have to look far to see how quickly the pandemic can get out of control. Through the summer, Manitoba had one of the lowest COVID case rates in Canada; several weeks passed with no new cases. Then the outbreaks began, community transmission skyrocketed, and now the province has the highest number of new cases per capita in Canada. Many people attribute the sharp rise in Manitoba’s cases to a false sense of security that developed because of the province’s low numbers. This may have contributed to the worsening situation in Saskatchewan as well. Until recently our numbers looked pretty good. Now, more of us have family and friends testing positive. As we realize that the virus is still here, we must acknowledge that we have the power to reduce its spread through our actions. To the west, Alberta’s per capita case numbers have consistently been among the highest in the country. It is currently second after Manitoba. Its government, like ours, is resolute about not issuing a second lockdown order and has resisted mandating masks provincewide. The dramatic rise in cases in Western Canada means simply that we are not doing enough. No one wants to return to the widespread, months-long lockdown we endured this spring. But governments must employ more specific types of restrictions. Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba and B.C. have all brought in targeted restrictions, focused on hot spots. Where these are insufficient, a short, sharp lockdown may be needed in order to break the chain of viral spread.

Article content Simply asking everyone to do the right thing is not working. So government must act. Public health restrictions and recommendations are only successful to the extent that the public follows them. If the public will not follow them voluntarily, they have to be made mandatory. Each and every one of us has to do our part to keep the virus from spreading. Citizens’ responsibility is to minimize the number of people they come in close contact with, wear a mask inside public spaces, stay home when not feeling well, and keep up the hand washing. And our government’s responsibility is to listen to public health advice and not be afraid to implement the kinds of decisive measures required to bring the pandemic back under control.

We need mandatory masks laws Back to video We are emerging from a severe lockdown, taking tentative steps into the unknown. Over a period of seven weeks, Canadians have endured the challenges of physical isolation. The pressure to reopen society is immense, but many share our concern that reopening will cause a second wave of cases. Advice for hand hygiene and physical distancing has been widely adopted and accepted. Why not masks? Citing asymptomatic and presymptomatic spread, on April 6 Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief medical officer of health, stated “wearing a non-medical mask … is an additional measure that you can take to protect others around you in situations where physical distancing is difficult.”

Article content This is hardly a rousing endorsement. Similar weak recommendations have come from other public health officials, like Dr. Bonnie Henry of B.C., and Dr. Deena Hinshaw of Alberta. Public health officials presumably aren’t convinced that evidence is strong enough to make a stronger recommendation for universal wear. The gold standard of evidence in medicine is the randomized controlled trial, where two populations are randomly assigned the intervention, and then a measurement of the intervention’s effectiveness is made. Unfortunately, this doesn’t exist for a population-scale intervention like masking. So instead we need to rely on the best available evidence, and the precautionary principle. Michael Ryan of the WHO says: “If you need to be right before you move, you will never win. Perfection is the enemy of the good when it comes to emergency management.”

Article content As we learn more about asymptomatic spread, superspreader events, droplet transmission and the utility of masks as barriers, it is evident that masks play an important role. Countries with mandatory mask laws have seen their curves bend towards zero, contrary to countries with voluntary recommendations such as Canada, the U.K. and the U.S. There are exceptions, such as Iceland, Australia and New Zealand, which have successfully tamped down the curve without mandatory masks. Each has its own story, including massive testing, or extremely early lockdown. But these are few and far between. All of these layers, such as physical distancing, contact tracing, isolation, lockdowns, and masks, act to decrease the R0: the average number of people each viral-shedding person infects. Above 1? The infection grows in a population. Below 1? It shrinks. Scientists believe it could be up to 5.7 in a population without any mitigation measures.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content A recent scientific paper looked at how the combination of a mask’s effectiveness and the proportion of a population wearing it worked to decrease the R0. If the mask is only moderately effective, as in cloth masks, the proportion wearing it needs to be high. For example, a cloth mask, which may only be 60 per cent effective, requires 60 per cent compliance to drop the Ro below one. In a recent poll, abysmally only 33 per cent of Canadians are wearing masks, Quebec being the worst at 24 per cent. Like many previous public health measures such as seatbelts, or bicycle helmets, compliance is poor until legislated. Similarly, if we want people to wear masks, we need them to be mandatory. Another advantage to masks, aside from saving lives, is reopening the economy.

Article content South Korea, Czechia, Austria, China are all countries with mandatory or high levels of mask compliance that have enabled their economies to open up, with minimal increases in COVID mortality. A recent economic analysis of mask use estimated a value of $3,000 to $6,000 to the economy for each mask worn. Possible harm? Literally billions of people are masking in 79 countries around the world without worsening their COVID-19 numbers — good evidence of minimal risk. Multiple provinces are starting to open up their economies. Quebec and Ontario are still in the throes of severe outbreaks. In both situations, mandatory masking will help save lives and prevent a recurrence, providing a massive return on investment. I protect you, you protect me. We all protect society.

The “system” in Canada will not fix itself on the current logic of things. Our national stupor requires not caressing and succour, but rather courageous circuit-breakers. The first lockdown succeeded in driving thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses across the country out of existence.

A second lockdown would only succeed in destroying many thousands more businesses and collapsing several already-destabilized public-school systems across the country. To be clear, these would be historical policy crimes. The implicit “contract” between government and citizens during lockdown holds that, in exchange for the obedience and inactivity of the population, those authorities enacting and enforcing the lockdown will do everything legally and humanly possible to save lives and livelihoods.

Article content In any lockdown scenario, then, government leaders and civil servants cannot assume a 9 a.m.-to-5 p.m. existence. They cannot presume to govern only by Zoom and abstract decree. Nay, they must provide the missing energy to the society forced to quarantine, and therefore cannot allow a family business built through decades’ worth of toil, blood and treasure to simply go extinct without exhausting every line of direct communication, support and aggressive remedy.

Article content Ten months into the pandemic, our testing capacity, systems and technologies remain primitive at best and third-world at worst. Clearly, the work to get this right was not put in during the last quarantine, and so a second mass quarantine would be imposed on the strength of half-baked numbers and a lazy national capture by the degenerate daily loop of COVID case counts – a count that by now can only have meaning if juxtaposed with effective unemployment rates approaching 20%, huge jumps in homelessness, and massive rises in mental health and other public health afflictions across the country. We Canadians have a huge fight on our hands. Now is not the time for passivity or theatre. The fight is less about the future “ends” than about the energy with which we Canadians must exit the multiple crises in which the country finds itself. Whether our post-pandemic reality is to be “green” or “purple” or “orange” is of lesser consequence than the need for Canada to pivot out of the COVID emergency kinetically and with a national sense of mission. Without such energy and purpose, we will get nowhere fast as a country. But with it, we give Canada a fighting chance to emerge from this tragedy as still one of the world’s most admired countries. — Studin is president of the Institute for 21st Century Questions, and editor-in-chief and publisher of Global Brief Magazine.

Article content There are, as American examples, President Joe Biden cancelling federal permits for the Keystone XL pipeline and the goings-on this year at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission where the chairman (appointed by Biden) made climate disclosures a top priority. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Guest Opinion: Trudeau and Biden peddling climate change alarmism Back to video Mandating climate disclosures is premised on the idea that financial markets fail to properly account for climate change risks; thus, the government should force companies to disclose such risks and how they plan to mitigate them. This idea, however, that private investors need advice from the federal government on how to invest and what they should demand companies disclose, is dubious to say the least. Nevertheless, in Canada too, the federal government has shown significant enthusiasm for mandating climate disclosures.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content Last year, a loan program to help large employers survive the COVID lockdowns required recipient companies “to publish annual climate-related financial disclosure reports, including how their future operations will support environmental sustainability and national climate goals.” With the more than $100 billion expropriated from Canadian taxpayers to fund federal climate spending since 2015 apparently insufficient, the Trudeau government is bent on conscripting private capital through regulation as well to bolster its ammunition in the climate wars. The goal, it should be clear, has nothing to do with improving financial markets and everything to do with raising public alarm about climate change.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content Indeed, if the goal is to improve investment decisions through corporate risk disclosure mandates, it’s odd that Ottawa would elevate climate change above any number of greater risks — the possibilities of world war, riots and political unrest, cyberattacks, epidemics and so on. We could also add to the list of risks greater than climate change itself, the risk of activist politicians imposing economically destructive policies to deal with climate change. Both Joe Biden and Justin Trudeau are committed to emissions targets with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C, but as economists Robert P. Murphy and Ross McKitrick reported in a recent Fraser Institute paper, this goal comes with significant economic costs and “did not arise from the economics literature or from formal cost-benefit analysis.”
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) admitted in its 2018 report, Murphy and McKitrick note, that policies for achieving the 1.5C target would only be justified if the environmental damages of carbon emissions in 2030 ranges from $135 to $5,500 per tonne — or about two to 89 times what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated earlier this year. Murphy and McKitrick also cited the work of economist William Nordhaus, who was awarded the Nobel prize for his work analyzing the long-term economic effects of climate change and climate policies. According to Nordhaus’s 2016 modelling work, achieving the 1.5C target would probably be so economically destructive that people would be better off if governments did nothing about climate change. If governments are really convinced that companies should be forced to make disclosures on the financial risks of climate change, it would make more sense to have the companies disclose how they plan to deal with the risks posed by economically destructive federal climate policies than the risks posed by climate change itself. The former, after all, is likely a greater financial risk to most companies than the latter. Matthew Lau is an adjunct scholar with the Fraser Institute.

For months, the industry has worked with scientists and public health officials to explore the effectiveness of various quarantine periods and to evaluate testing and rapid screening as ways to protect travellers and borders. They did all of this without question, despite the fact that few COVID-19 cases in Canada are attributed to travel exposures and there are no documented cases of onboard transmissions in Canada.

Article content This past weekend, at the prime minister’s request, they took the unprecedented step of suspending all flights to the Caribbean and Mexico. Simultaneously, they overhauled their schedules to ensure that in-bound international flights land in one of only four cities: Montreal, Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver. These latest moves will inflict further financial damage on a sector that is already hemorrhaging cash, having experienced declines in passenger traffic of as much as 95 per cent. In light of this, it is both baffling and tragic that — more than 10 months into the pandemic — the federal government still has not brought forward a comprehensive plan to save the industry from financial collapse. When the first COVID-19 lockdowns were announced last spring, Ottawa’s official position was that it did not want to waste valuable time creating a range of “sector-specific” business support programs.

Article content It chose instead to roll out broad-based initiatives such as the federal wage subsidy, which was designed to help any employer that experienced a significant drop in revenues. That approach might have sufficed had the health emergency lasted only a few months, but it long ago stopped making sense. Only major changes to existing relief programs would have made them effective for the long haul. No other group of major employers in Canada has been hit as hard as the airlines. At Air Canada and WestJet alone, well over 30,000 skilled workers have lost their jobs. In the aviation sector overall, almost half of all members of Unifor, Canada’s largest private-sector union, have either been laid off, furloughed or had their jobs eliminated.

Article content In last September’s throne speech, the federal government hinted that financial support was on the way. Yet here we are in February and the industry is still waiting. Apart from Italy, Canada is the only country in the G7 that has not offered major financial aid to its domestic air carriers. What are we waiting for? Without government assistance, a vital part of Canada’s national strategic infrastructure will suffer serious damage, causing long-term harm for Canadians. Airlines, airports and the rest of Canada’s aviation sector are essential not just to the economy, but to countless communities from coast to coast to coast. The longer Ottawa delays, the more costly the consequences. To survive, airlines have been forced to drastically cut back their routes, leaving some communities with no flights at all.

Article content On top of that, training programs to replace retiring air traffic controllers have been cancelled, which will inevitably lead to future shortages. Any major restart of air travel, when it comes, could be hampered if workers such as pilots, air traffic controllers and mechanics have not been able to maintain their skills and qualifications. Pilots, for example, must keep flying or risk losing their licenses. Recertifying a pilot can take as long as two years and is extremely expensive. Countries around the world have recognized that it is in their national interest to have a strong airline sector. Airlines and aviation workers connect us to the world and to one another. The industry is a vital part of Canada’s trade in goods and services and a key linchpin in the tourism industry. When the pandemic ends, Canadians will once again be eager to explore our vast country and get together with loved ones. Ottawa must step in now with a plan to safely reopen the aviation sector and ensure the survival of an essential service. National Post Jerry Dias is the national president of Unifor.

Article content Calgary had the good sense to require proof of vaccination or on-site rapid testing when they reopened the Stampede’s live music venue. Manitoba had the good sense to require full vaccination of people over 12 to see the Blue Bombers. Ontario also seems to be learning, requiring masks for students returning to school. And Quebec is leading the way with vaccine passports.

Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: Governments' parochial path leading us into collision with Delta variant Back to video We know where most Canadians stand. A recent Nanos poll shows that people want reassurances when we go into public spaces as nearly 80 per cent support denying the unvaccinated access to things like sporting events or indoor dining. The Saskatchewan government has consistently taken a short-sighted, parochial path. It was slow to mandate masks and, initially, took the utterly silly position that rural people could be excluded. It resisted restrictions on workplaces, shopping and entertainment. It fell into the trap that backfired in England and Sweden, making lockdowns more likely, by not taking precautions to keep infections low enough to allow testing and tracing. Saskatchewan has now also lifted some quarantine requirements. Ignoring the epidemiology, it has naively seen vaccination as a technological fix. Premier Scott Moe even referred positively to England’s quick opening up, with their vaccination rate rising , without seeming to grasp that the Delta variant was already taking over. His officials should be checking the John Hopkins COVID mortality database. Boris Johnson’s U.K. has the highest death rate, of 195 per 100,000, of any G7 country. It has more than twice the death rate of Canada (71) and is even higher than the U.S. (188), which, largely due to parochial, nationalistic and yes, lying of Trump, has seen nearly 620,000 deaths.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content We see where the parochial, libertarian views take us in Republican-controlled states like Florida, Texas and Louisiana, where laissez-faire approaches fuel a deadly fourth wave. Even as the older population, previously so at risk, gets more protection, mutations make the Delta variant more dangerous to young people. Almost one-fifth of recent U.S. infections have been among children. The vast majority of people hospitalized and dying are from the unvaccinated, but a small number of fully vaccinated can still get infected and/or be carriers. Some vaccinated people remain quite vulnerable. This shows why the majority have a right to know about their risks in public spaces. We felt relatively safe going into a store with everyone wearing a mask. Now none of us know who hasn’t been vaccinated when we enter mask-free public spaces. Western provinces are presently leading Canada’s rising rate in COVID cases . It was asinine to abandon indoor masking with the signs of a fourth wave. A democracy must always protect the rights of minorities, including political minorities. However, rule by the political minority is not acceptable. Nor is it acceptable for political leaders to appease minorities even if this population is critical to their re-election in our easily fragmented, first-past-the-post electoral system. It is disconcerting for Premier Moe to act as a head of state and compare us with another country, as justification for his lackadaisical approaches. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney is also resorting to this. This shows just how balkanized partisan politics has become, especially, it seems, among provinces that stubbornly cling to high carbon economies. And there is an underlying ideology that relies on parochialism doesn’t stand up.

When the health minister received the letter from 300 doctors, urging immediate action, he politely said he’d “follow public health advice.” Yet when chief medical health officer Dr. Saqib Shahab speaks about continuing the piecemeal approach, he gives vague, politicized answers; pep talks. We can’t keep hiding behind opinion and jurisdiction. Genetic vaccines will not be a magic bullet and it may take a year to see how effective they are overall. A federally co-ordinated plan is long overdue. Some still say we should wait for this pandemic to end to evaluate our shortcomings. Nonsense. Some advisors stubbornly believed the threat would be a new influenza, not a more contagious SARS. Decision-makers didn’t ask probing questions. Multi-disciplinary teams, to guide decisive action, were not quickly put in place. Countries, like Canada, were caught with a chronic lack of PPE and testing capacity. And Canada’s hospital capacity has steadily declined. There was only fleeting capacity to create integrated policies. Mixed messaging laid more ground for conspiracy “theories.” The mass media reported aggregate numbers without meaningful context.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content It is not surprising that we remain without sufficient public health understanding or compliance. And ignoring these shortcomings sets us up to repeat them. Saskatchewan has been steadily falling into the same trap as Manitoba, as well as North Dakota, where proactive “public health” actions such as universal mask usage, were sidelined, supposedly to avoid economic impact and/or political backlash. This has been self-defeating; both now face lockdowns. Testing and tracking only work if other measures like mask usage are firmly in place. Opening schools is fine, but as Quebec shows, this is only viable if community spread is under control. Disruptive school closures may soon return. Political leaders like Alberta Premier Jason Kenney continually emphasize minimizing “impairment” to the economy. Fearing lockdowns, they fail to give uniform messaging. This continues regarding sizes of gatherings. They are not solely to blame. In July, the WHO issued an advisory that this virus was airborne. Why did it take until now to get reliable information about safe masks being three-layered? Early false messaging flew in the face of best practices in several Asian countries. This was probably rationalized to crisis manage scarcity of PPE for hospitals. We need to “do unto others” for the Golden Rule to work in public health. And we don’t only wear masks to protect others; we wear them to protect ourselves. You can’t expect different results if you don’t embrace different practices.

South Korea, where universal mask use and effective testing and tracking has helped control surges and avert reactive lockdowns, is still under one (yes one). Saskatchewan remains on the verge of a surge because decision-makers seem inclined to wishful thinking and “advisers” are still reading political lips. Premier Moe calling this a “slowdown” just adds to the confusion. This is not a way forward. Nor are anti-mask protests. Informed health officials are again saying “stay home, socialize only with your household”? Better late than never will not protect healthcare and precarious workers, seniors, young adults at growing risk, or small businesses who remain pawns in the fools-game.

This month the premier acknowledged the link between provincial workplace policies and public health by legislating paid time off for workers to get the vaccine.
It’s time to take the next step and legislate employer-paid sick leave for all Saskatchewan’s workers.
If you already have paid sick leave — you’re in the minority. Most workers in Saskatchewan do not have paid sick day benefits. Among low-paid workers, that figure rises even higher. It should also be no surprise that more women than men don’t have paid sick leave.
The fact is COVID-19 lockdowns and stay-at-home orders do not work without paid sick leave.
While the federal government’s Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit is, at least in theory, helping workers with COVID symptoms stay home, it is temporary, insufficient and inconvenient.
To qualify, a worker must miss a full week of work. It only provides a mere $450 per week to people who have had to miss work due to COVID-19. It does not provide the same security that paid sick leave would, as processing delays of up to four weeks is too late for many workers living paycheque to paycheque.
Workers who can’t afford to take a massive pay cut are still forced to make a choice between a paycheque or going to work and infecting others.
When someone decides to stay home because they have a runny nose or a new cough, it’s not to benefit their health, it’s for the rest of us. Why should they have to pay?"

Article content In the midst of a global pandemic, many around the world have been deeply disturbed by the alleged murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in broad daylight. Even more shocking was the fact that three of his fellow officers actively participated. Second-degree murder charges have been laid against the officer who pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck, and the others have now been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. The debate that has ensued in Canada in the aftermath has been mixed, with some acknowledging that racism exists in Canada, and others outright denying it.

Over the centuries, the economic and political imbalances between communities have been redefined with each new wave of immigration, as evidenced by the fact that we scrapped and denounced the head tax, only to impose another variant of it — a now normalized right of landing fee.

Through solid political and civic engagement with our democratic institutions, social and economic justice can be achieved. Canadian values and, in particular, true conservative principles, have and will continue to shape a fairer and more inclusive Canada. An essential first step is to recognize and admit that there are social and economic challenges to overcome.

Article content Photo by JEAN LEVAC/Postmedia Take the current COVID-19 crisis, for example. Data shows that visible minority groups in Canada have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic and the economic fallout resulting from the tough social-distancing measures that have been put in place. This is coming on top of endemic economic and health crises in these communities, yet Canada still refuses to collect ethnicity-related health and mortality data, in contrast to many other OECD countries, including the U.S. According to Statistics Canada, approximately one in four Canadians could become financially vulnerable due to work interruptions and economic lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This is particularly concerning for visible minority groups. The Ontario Anti-Racism Directorate’s 2017 community consultations found that black-Canadians face major obstacles when looking for employment. Even though the black community has achieved much success in many sectors, systemic discrimination puts a significant section of the community at risk. This is especially true during periods of great economic uncertainty, such as we find ourselves in today.

Article content Marginalized communities are negatively impacted in many other ways, as well, including: over-representation in the criminal justice system; lower levels of educational attainment; poorer health and quality of life; restricted access to capital and less property ownership. These outcomes reinforce systemic barriers. The Association of Black Conservatives (ABC) actively promotes civic engagement and political participation because these are the proven pathways towards reform. It is only through active engagement in democratic politics at all levels — municipal, provincial and federal — that real and lasting systemic change can be achieved. Photo by Carlos Osorio/Reuters Moreover, it is critical that all communities, particularly disadvantaged communities, engage with all political parties and not just left-leaning parties that act as though they are entitled to the visible minority vote. It is essential that marginalized communities are not just in the room, but are also in decision-making positions. This is not about quotas; it is about diversity.

Article content Canada needs to come to terms with the fact that our standards regarding diversity and equity fails to meet acceptable standards in 2020. Sound conservative values, such as fiscal responsibility, an economy that works for all, fairness, opportunity, self-reliance, respect for the rule of law and personal freedom are essential if we hope to level the socioeconomic playing field and allow communities and individuals to thrive. Economic inequality and social injustice are enduring problems that require sound policies and political commitment. ABC believes in advancing the principles of equity and inclusion for the black-Canadian community and all Canadians. As we look to build a better and stronger country after COVID-19, persistent socioeconomic inequalities in visible minority groups can no longer be overlooked. The True North is stronger and freer when individuals can reach their full potential. We are, after all, our brothers’ and sisters’ keepers.

Article content The state of our collective mental health has been the centre of many conversations since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is no surprise, given the immense changes in the structure of our lives that most people have felt some level of increased mental health challenges. The Mental Health Research Canada 4th National Report has indicated that anxiety and depression are at their highest since the pandemic started, reporting that four times the number of Canadians are experiencing high anxiety levels, and the rates of depression have more than doubled since the start of the pandemic.

Article content Historically, Indigenous peoples experience a much higher rate of mental health challenges. Stats Canada reports that the discrepancies between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples and health have long been reported, noting that we continue to see the effects of intergenerational trauma from Indian Residential Schools in Indigenous communities. The report notes that food and job insecurity, poverty, and unemployment all play a role in mental health challenges that Indigenous peoples continue to face.

The report indicated that, for many Indigenous people, there was a direct path from residential school to prison, many seeing the prison system, as a continuation of the Indian Residential School System .

Article content The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health states that prisoners are four to seven times more likely to suffer from a mental illness. More importantly, they note that poverty, abuse, growing up in broken homes, and addictions are determining factors in mental health challenges. For Indigenous people, who make up the largest portion of those who are incarcerated in Canada, colonialism has not only created the conditions that lead to their criminalization through the Indian Residential School system, but continues to maintain the cycle of punishment and containment of Indigenous peoples through the penal system. Claims by Correctional Service Canada ( CSC) that prisons include culturally relevant and responsive supports and programming, and the RCMP claiming reconciliation efforts, have done little to affect the criminalization of Indigenous peoples, as we have continued to see an increase in the mass incarceration of Indigenous peoples from 2015 , when the TRC report was released. This increase indicates what many people are starting to realize, that the prison system does not protect and keep people safe. Instead, it perpetuates a cycle of violence and inequity that has exacerbated the mental health challenges faced by Indigenous people, and indeed all those who have been incarcerated during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Article content The Covid-19 pandemic has intensified the already inhumane conditions inside prisons, with reports of prisoners being on strict lockdowns for almost entire days . Since the start of the pandemic, many prisoners have been forced to go without the support and connection of loved ones as almost all federal Institutions and all Alberta correctional institutions continue to not allow any in-person visitations. The lockdowns, limited PPE, inability to social distance, inadequate nutrition, and no access to mental health supports have been at the centre of multiple prisoner hunger strikes across Canada. Those of us on the outside, who recognize the harms of the penal system are working together to end this cycle of violence for Indigenous peoples, and all those who experience the harms of this system. There are individuals and communities across Canada, who are actively working towards creating new systems of care. We are all committed to working towards a new kind of safety, and accountability for all of our communities. Karrie Auger is a community organizer and member of Free Lands Free Peoples.

Article content As we navigate the COVID-19 crisis, Canada has mishandled the safe reopening of our country to domestic and international air travel. That may be about to change.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content This week, in partnership with the federal government, Alberta began a pilot project that allows incoming travellers, including international visitors, to quarantine for only 48 hours. It is based on science and testing, an approach the entire country appears to have thus far ignored. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.
tap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: Testing is the key to reviving travel and tourism Back to video Under the plan, travellers can get tested upon their arrival in Alberta and will have to isolate for two days if the test is negative, instead of the 14 days now generally required upon entry to Canada. To confirm they are COVID-free, they will be tested again six or seven days later and have to remain in Alberta for 14 days. For now, this option is only available to people arriving at Calgary airport and one land border crossing. If Alberta’s approach is successful, it will be a victory for science and reason and should lead to Canada reopening nation-wide to international travel, the lack of which has devastated our economy and the lives of millions of Canadians.

Article content Travel and tourism represent roughly two per cent of GDP and four per cent of Canadian jobs. Yet since March, our borders have remained largely closed. Even within Canada, the “Atlantic bubble” is almost entirely off limits to domestic travel, making Canada one of the few countries continuing to limit internal movement. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), based in Montreal, ironically, said that if Canada doesn’t ease its Draconian travel restrictions, it estimates that about 410,000 jobs and some $39 billion of Canada’s GDP will be at risk. It doesn’t have to be this way. Alberta’s initiative follows numerous countries that recognize severe travel restrictions as unnecessary and that have enacted sensible policies allowing people to move inside and beyond their borders with relative freedom.

Article content A recent report by the United Nations World Tourism Organization showed that, of countries with advanced economies, 79 per cent have loosened restrictions. In Germany, which drastically outperforms Canada in deaths and cases per million, testing at airports has been in place for months. Results are available in hours and a negative test allows people to avoid Germany’s 10-day quarantine, which is only required for travellers coming from a “risk area.” South Korea, New Zealand and others that have managed the pandemic better than Canada have implemented similar testing policies. Federal Transport Minister Marc Garneau says the government is protecting against travel-related COVID-19 cases, employing such measures as “screening questions, temperature measurements, the fact that they must wear masks.” Yet nearly six months after our peers have done so, Canada still does not have an adequate testing system in place.

Article content While there is reticence about opening our borders, much of this fear is misplaced, and a rigorous testing regime can help assuage these concerns. A recent report by IATA found that only 44 cases of COVID-19 have resulted from air travel globally in 2020, while airlines have carried 1.2 billion passengers. To open safely, Canada should require visitors to show a negative test before they travel here, and follow the Alberta pilot project model of shorter quarantines and multiple tests upon arrival. The coronavirus is serious and we should be taking all reasonable precautions. However, as we learn more every day, we should understand that an overreaction now doesn’t make up for Canada’s lack of action in the past.

They disobeyed wrong laws, according to your comment. When peaceful protesters are being penalized (financially or otherwise), it’s a beginning sign of tyranny, not a free, democratic society.

Article content CARBON TAX IS GOOD Re: Kris Sims’ Dec. 15 guest opinion. Why does she only talk about the cost of the carbon tax but not mention anything about its purpose or the tax credit rebate we all get to offset it ($666 for a couple and more if you have kids in 2019). I have a 2,500 sq. ft. house and paid $275 in carbon tax over the past 12 months. I have downsized to one vehicle and reduced my miles driven, which is the purpose of the tax, reduce emissions. Not only is it good for the environment but it also improves our way of life through less pollution, not to mention the savings to our health-care system that undoubtedly will occur when our air quality improves. The carbon tax is the only way to go as it penalizes those who pollute and benefits those who want to reduce emissions. Rather than just complain why not come up with a better solution.

Article content One year ago, I received an email from a colleague which contained a slide deck that had been presented internally to leadership within the Saskatchewan Health Authority. In the presentation, my friend and colleague Dr. Nathaniel Osgood presented modelling data that demonstrated the potential devastation that COVID-19 could wreak on our health-care system and our province at large. With visions of northern Italy and New York City fresh in my mind, I felt a horrible pit in my stomach. Was this the end of the world?

Article content What happened next were frantic efforts to mobilize immediate action. The need to lock down and eliminate close contact between persons, the need to rapidly expand our contact tracing and public health capacity, and to rapidly bolster our health-care system for the impending surge. The province shut down. We waited, and waited. Soon, it became evident that we would not be overwhelmed. There was a hopeful address given on April 22 hinting at reopening the province, slowly and methodically. I remember listening to Premier Moe’s address, the first such address in Canada, and beaming with pride — yes, we did it, Saskatchewan! We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

I became worried and anxious watching our neighbours in Alberta reach the breaking point with their health-care system before slowdown measures were finally announced. We called for lockdown, for diligent attention by the public to the guidance from Dr. Saqib Shahab, and warned once again as cases rose dramatically in our vulnerable inner-city populations that we could be overwhelmed. The province slowed down, but did not shut down. We survived, albeit while suffering the highest per-capita rates of cases and deaths in Canada. A heavy cost to pay, but nonetheless, crisis was averted once again. Now, as Regina faces the highest proportion of variants of concern (VoCs) in Canada, what is old is new again. VoCs are more transmissible and more deadly, and experts are once again calling for lockdown . Across Saskatchewan, the citizenry is burdened by COVID fatigue, isolation, and the physical and mental exhaustion of the past 12 months. So are front-facing essential workers and health-care workers. The question of the moment from many is simple: “Do we really need to lock down again? You ‘experts’ have called for this before, and we were fine. What’s different now?”
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content When I learned that in Regina between 70 and 80 per cent of recently screened cases were caused by VoCs , I felt the same sick pit in my stomach as I did a year ago. Widespread community transmission of VoCs in Regina will fuel widespread community transmission of VoCs across the province. It is only a matter of time. Hospitals and ICUs will fill again — they already have in Regina. This March, unlike last, we have a new weapon to fight COVID-19. We have vaccines against SaRs-CoV-2, and they work tremendously well. Even with VoCs like B.1.1.7 here in Saskatchewan, vaccines protect us against severe illness, hospitalization and death. We need to buy as much time as we can to vaccinate as much of the citizenry of the province as possible to prevent a significant surge from VoCs. To falter at this stage and be overwhelmed with new cases with vaccine so close at hand would be tragic irony. We have come so far, Saskatchewan, to fail now. I grew up in Ontario, did my post-graduate training in Alberta and began working full time in Regina in 2011. Much of what drew me to this province was the collective spirit of Saskatchewanians, the desire to do good by our provincial motto, Multis e gentibus vires — From Many Peoples Strength. We need to channel that collective spirit in this moment as we face our greatest threat. Please, follow the public health guidance, keep your personal and family bubbles extremely tight, isolate and test when symptomatic. And get vaccinated when it is your turn.

A 75-per-cent wage subsidy has been promised, but the details haven’t been released. Businesses that qualify will have to apply for it every month through a web portal which has yet to be constructed. If everything goes as planned, a business can expect to start receiving money in three to six weeks. But what if everything doesn’t go to plan? Canada has been in lockdown since March. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said: “30 per cent of small firms say they can survive less than a month in the current situation.”

Article content It’s been a month already, and in that time thousands of businesses have folded. The government has offered $40,000 loans for small businesses but only for non-deferrable expenses and only through existing financial institutions. Credit unions, which many Alberta businesses use for banking, were not eligible to offer these loans. New clients aren’t eligible to receive these loans, so if a business switches from a credit union to one of the big banks to receive this help, they won’t be eligible there either. As well, many business owners don’t qualify for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) help because of how their payroll is structured or due to the minimum payroll required to qualify. Numerous business owners have written me to ask for help navigating through this program, which has changed several times since first announced last month.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content The details that have been made available are scarce and I have been told that the resulting uncertainty has led to banks being reluctant to issue the loans. In comparison, the Small Business Administration in the United States has paid out more than 220,000 similar loans to businesses already. The bottom line is that we were told, in just a matter of weeks, the government would be able to create and start providing help for businesses. At the same time, the government has also said the first cheques from this program won’t be issued until at least May, by which point many businesses will have permanently closed. Canada can and must do better. We have proposed that all goods and services taxes remitted in the last 12 months be refunded. Small businesses that are run by owner-operators should be eligible for the wage subsidy. Businesses should have immediate access to loans that can help them bridge the gap between their current payroll needs and the arrival of the funds they have been promised. These measures would be a welcome beginning to a more comprehensive relief solution than the government has currently proposed. Above all, the government must be clear and transparent with Canadians. Canadian businesses need certainty that there is help available to them and that it will come, sooner rather than later. Matt Jeneroux is member of Parliament for Edmonton Riverbend.

Another 2 million people were technically still employed but saw their work hours drastically reduced. While the feds and provinces are doing all they can to prop the economy up, individuals and businesses are falling through the cracks and the longer this goes on the more businesses will close their doors and families will face serious hardships. The justification for a closure throughout the summer came during Dr. Tam’s press conference on Thursday announcing the projections for infected cases and fatalities.

However, if we keep our current stringent measures in place the virus will have a much reduced death toll of 4,500 lives throughout its course. The Canadian Press reported that “Tam said it appeared the spread of the virus was moderating somewhat and that Canada could bring the epidemic under control by the end of summer if social distancing and other measures in place were strictly adhered to. With spotty controls, we could still be battling the tail end of the pandemic a year from now, she said.” It’s a punch to the gut, that’s for sure. The idea that this new reality will persist for almost six more months will be too much for some to bear.

Article content When Ontario first announced schools were closing, it was for two weeks following March Break. That has since been extended, of course, but the province committed itself to taking things two weeks at a time. Why isn’t the Public Health Agency of Canada doing the same and agreeing to take things a week or two at a time? In some respects, Dr. Tam and her provincial counterparts have wielded more power over Canadian life than any other public servant or politician in history, more so than prime ministers or the likes of cabinet minister C.D. Howe, who was called The Minister of Everything during the Second World War. Is anyone double-checking Dr. Tam’s work? Is anyone in a position of power pushing back? Is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau seeking a second opinion, like most people would after being given such a harsh diagnosis?

It’s just common sense questions that everyone should be asking when dealing with a situation of such colossal magnitude. That, and anyone who is reading about COVID-19 strategies around the world will know that there is no settled science here and experts are in stark disagreement. “The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted just how many ways that scientists and other academic experts can disagree,” writes Alyson Nicholds, a public policy professor from Staffordshire University, in an essay for The Conversation titled Coronavirus: Why experts disagree so strongly over how to tackle the disease .

Article content The strategies around the world are diverse. While some countries’ top epidemiologists are urging complete lockdowns, a number of other top public health officials, such as those in Sweden, are resisting lockdowns on the basis that the societal and economic damages may outweigh those of the virus. We haven’t heard much about those secondary, but perhaps equally bad, effects from Canadian officials. Are they factoring them in? Or are they singularly focused on their specialization, on beating back the number of infected cases whatever it takes? We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

This is to be expected in a fast-changing situation, but it has still undeniably harmed the credibility of our top health officials in the eyes of the public and will make rigid enforcement throughout the summer that much more difficult. Maybe Dr. Tam is right that the only way to beat this down is to live in relative lockdown until the fall. Or maybe the experts who disagree are right. That’s quite a coin toss to make. Let’s hope that the leaders Canadians elected to make whole-of-society decisions for us at the very least aren’t just blindly following the recommendations of health officials, that they’re weighing all of the options and that they’re taking the time to get a second opinion.

Article content As a front-line ICU physician in Alberta who studies health-care quality, one thing that has surprised me the most during this pandemic is the apparent free pass the Canadian academic community has afforded our federal leadership and its response during this crisis. The medical community seems to have focused its critique solely on public lockdown measures at the provincial level. Yet, there has been little academic discussion around our significant failures in early vaccine procurement, scientific understanding of how this virus spreads, rapid testing, and effective border control.

Article content Our collective public focus to date has been almost entirely on debating the acceptable degree of public lockdowns needed for the greater good. Pandemic shaming this year has rivalled hockey as a national sport. During the first wave, this likely served us well. Now, as the U.S. and U.K. outperform us in delivering vaccines to their peoples, our per capita infection rate has climbed above both. The CDC this month asked Americans to avoid all travel to Canada. For a country that often prides itself on being morally and socially superior to our southern cousins on matters of health and universal care, this inglorious distinction not only demonstrates our failures on COVID, but it shakes the very core of how we see ourselves as Canadians.

Article content On any given day, there is another expert or physician in the media criticizing the Doug Ford or Jason Kenney governments for not going far enough or acting fast enough on lockdowns. These critics may have valid points. However, as Toronto’s year-long experience has shown, lockdowns alone are not enough to overcome this crisis. A singular focus on social-distancing measures both in the Canadian medical community and media has distracted from meaningful critique and debate about all other aspects of our COVID response. Improved responses in such areas of federal control as vaccine procurement and border control likely would have averted a third wave. Unfortunately, in these aspects, the academic community has been silent.

Article content Improved responses ... likely would have averted a third wave The National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommended delaying second doses of two-shot COVID-19 vaccines by up to four months. While this may be the most prudent action to take given our severe vaccine shortage, what has alarmed me is the deafening silence the academic community has had on this most significant public health policy decision, perhaps the most significant in decades. The original studies on vaccine efficacy had limited the intervals to under one month. Keep in mind that this is the same academic community that resisted early use of masks and border closures based on lack of evidence. Similarly, despite having had one year to enact an effective method of stopping COVID variants at our border, we have failed miserably at keeping out cases imported from such places as Brazil. Special screening for such travellers was dropped by Ottawa without as much as a peep from experts in our academic community.

Article content Theresa Tam, our top doctor, this month continued to claim that she was correct when she said COVID-19 posed only a low risk to Canada at the beginning of the pandemic. At the same time, Justin Trudeau has no regrets about our vaccine rollout. Of course, since Theresa Tam made that statement, over 23,000 Canadians have died. As for kudos for our national vaccine plan, Canada currently sits at number 45 worldwide when considering the total percentage of the population fully vaccinated. The field of health quality evolved in medicine because of statements such as these. Rather than accepting the status quo as the best we can do, the field of health quality determines the root causes for failures in our health-care system, and seeks to improve outcomes through culture and system changes. This is exactly what Canada’s public health response needs now.

The most commonly quoted reason for Canada’s vaccine failure has been the lack of domestic vaccine production infrastructure as a result of years of neglect. This may be part of the story, but we really don’t know. Without formal assessments of our response, using a health quality paradigm, we continue to place the lives of Canadians at risk. As for our economy, the world’s longest undefended border will continue to be closed, but this time it’s Americans who will want to keep us out.

Article content Blaming leaders such as Trudeau or Tam for uninspired leadership is likely an over-simplistic approach. However, we do have to hold them accountable. Otherwise, politicians claiming that this is the best we could do, will prevent us from finding the root causes of our failures and ultimately improving upon them. A first step is replacing the blame-and-shame game and focusing on systems thinking. We must have a paradigm that acknowledges the human condition — namely, that humans err. A single “sharp-end” error (the person in the control booth in the nuclear plant, the surgeon making the incision, a church ignoring lockdown rules, a PM high on platitudes but low on action) is rarely enough to cause harm on this level. Instead, Canada’s failure has involved errors across all levels of government that penetrated multiple incomplete layers of protection. A focus on pandemic shaming or being a good Canadian by taking it all in stride is unlikely to produce any meaningful changes to a response that’s clearly broken. There is nothing unCanadian or partisan about demanding a high-profile independent inquiry into our response now. Only by holding our leaders accountable and demanding improvements and change will we be better prepared to prevent a future crisis or, God forbid, a fourth wave this fall. We owe at least that much to the Canadians who will unnecessarily die in this third wave.

Article content A year ago, most Canadians had never heard of a novel coronavirus. Yet, COVID-19, a particularly virulent virus, dominated our lives and livelihoods in 2020 and will continue to shape them throughout the coming year. Its toll on public health, economies, government finances, businesses, and families will last for decades.

Article content We had been warned. On May 15, 2017, the cover of Time magazine blared, “Warning: We are not ready for the next pandemic.” A second “black swan” crisis in just two decades points to the need for better contingency planning and greater resiliency built into our core health, financial and economic systems. We should not forget these lessons as we look ahead. Canadian governments and Canadians face five must-tackle challenges in 2021. These will test our capacity for creative, collaborative, longer-term thinking, and whether we can raise our policy game to emerge stronger and more resilient in the post-COVID world.

Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: There are five must-tackle challenges for Canada in 2021 Back to video The first test for all governments is to control the pandemic. Without flattening the COVID curve, the nascent recovery will be planked. As we begin the initial phase of vaccinating Canadians, we are experiencing a significant second wave of the pandemic, leading to renewed lockdowns in various parts of the country and increasing pressures on the healthcare system. The slower the execution of the vaccination program, the slower the economic recovery and the greater the economic and social costs. We should have been better prepared after Canada’s experiences with SARS in 2003 and H1N1 in 2009.

Article content The second is a growth strategy for the recovery and beyond. The economy will not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2022, and that assumes a vaccine-assisted rebound combined with a shift in government spending from income and liquidity support to growth-enhancing measures. Beyond the immediate challenge of recovery, which is to get back to pre-COVID levels, we also face a troubling drop in longer-term real growth to 1.2 per cent according to Bank of Canada estimates. Rebuilding Canada’s potential growth will require a clear plan to improve our competitiveness, encourage productive investments and create a Canadian global advantage. Governments cannot solve all problems, but they can help create the conditions to make the private sector more successful. We are at one of those pivotal moments.

Article content A third test is the glaring absence of a fiscal anchor from the government’s policy playbook. A fiscal anchor is not something that waits for better times — it is something that is a prerequisite for sustained better times. Federal debt will have risen an astounding 75 per cent between last year and next year according to the Fall Economic Statement 2020. This debt burden, which future generations will bear, comes at both a cost and a risk. Debt servicing costs are manageable while interest rates are at abnormally low levels because of the pandemic recession, but they will gradually rise as growth returns and so will the costs of the mountain of new debt. The more immediate risk is that international financial markets begin to lose faith in our ability to manage our fiscal affairs. To avoid this, and its caustic effects on growth and confidence, the government should articulate a credible fiscal anchor.

Article content A related challenge is fiscal federalism: provincial fiscal situations are not good, some are dire, and all believe that increased federal transfers are in order, particularly since the federal government has loudly argued it has unused fiscal firepower. The health system clearly has to be better prepared for future pandemics, and this will take money, partnerships and surge capacity. And, with the Liberal government signalling new policy ambitions in areas of provincial or shared jurisdiction, the price tags to encourage provincial buy-in will be lofty. The fifth test is reconciling climate change and the Canadian energy sector, where the narrative has to change. Energy is our biggest export earner, and a major source of value-added growth, well-paying jobs and tax revenues. Climate change is a fundamental threat to the future. The challenge is how to sustain a robust Canadian energy sector and make progress on climate change — it is not an “either or” choice, it is about achieving both. And this is not just an Alberta problem, it is a pan-Canadian issue — both economically and politically.

Article content New thinking is desperately needed, such as the deployment of Generation IV small modular nuclear reactors to meet the steam and heat requirements of Alberta’s heavy oil industry, which are currently met by carbon-intensive fuels. This would dramatically limit greenhouse gas emissions from oilsands operations, allowing time for the province to diversify its economy during the transition to renewable energy. As Samantha Gross of the Brookings Institution has argued, “Those pushing to end fossil fuel production now are missing the point that fossil fuels will still be needed for some time in certain sectors. Eliminating unpopular energy sources or technologies, like nuclear or carbon capture, from the conversation is short-sighted. Renewable electricity generation alone won’t get us there — this is an all-technologies-on-deck problem.”

Article content There are decades where nothing happens and there are weeks where decades happen. This saying seems particularly apt to describe what has transpired during the pandemic. And we will continue to be tested, but the focus will shift from the immediate crisis to the recovery and beyond. The longer-term challenges before us in 2021 will also demand a much more innovative and co-operative approach to policy-making — both at home and with our allies. Having been caught flat-footed, the questions we need to ask ourselves today are do we have the necessary planning skills within government, the right incentives for private-sector expansion, and the collective will and wisdom to “build back better”?

Then there are the 10 per cent, the killjoys who arrive 45 minutes late and ask for an off-the-menu tomato salad (when the trees have already shed their fall bloom). Worse still are the ones who don’t even show up. Whereas a no-show for a corporate restaurant is a cold statistic, for an indie restaurant it’s personal, like an expression of contempt toward the house and its employees (empty tables generally do not tip well). When we reach out to the absent guests, we find ourselves ghosted like a teenage prom date, the corsage in a waste bin.

We make orders and receive goods, contact the bank over a potential NSF cheque, run to the SAQ only to find no tequila (yes, it happened; zero, nothing, nada). We try to bring new ideas to the table (literally), while still maintaining quality control. All for an empty table No. 6 and a broken promise. Tables are real estate for a restaurant; they must be filled twice a night for the business to stay healthy while maintaining low menu prices. Turning a table is oxygen for the industry. So please do not be critical when we ask “early or late” as we take your reservation, or insist on 7 p.m., which is not sustainable for us.

The present staffing crisis for the service industry is a future cheffing crisis. Many of us fell in love with restaurants as dishwashers and bussers, tasting the adrenaline rush and seeing miraculous foods for the first time. Enrolment is down in cooking schools.

But the rebounds we have seen are different than a truly sustainable recovery. Our collective focus is currently on the light at the end of the vaccine tunnel – which is genuinely hopeful – but today we risk losing sight of the continued turbulence in the labour market and what that means for the Canadians bearing the brunt of it. The blunt truth of our economic reality is we aren’t all in this together. With the so-called “K-shape” recovery taking place, those on the bottom continue to face business restrictions, lockdowns, and lost jobs. Targeted support for those most impacted must be in place into 2022.

Article content The recent lockdowns will mean more permanent business closures. The job prospects for displaced workers grow slimmer with every month in lockdown as more businesses throw in the towel. Canada’s entrepreneurs are tapped out and the longer restrictions continue, the worse the situation will become. At the same time, the third wave is also wreaking particular havoc on women and young Canadians. With school closures and summer break fast approaching, juggling childcare and work responsibilities will once more become a logistical and mental health burden that may very well lead to even more primary care givers, the majority of whom are women, involuntarily leaving the workforce. Students and young Canadians looking for summer and entry level jobs will also continue to struggle.

Canadians also need a plan for what happens next. Other countries are announcing their reopening plans now because they understand businesses need lead time to prepare, especially in the travel sector. Yet Canada’s strategy remains a mystery. The success or failure of our recovery will depend on what we do and how we plan now. The better we plan today, the more efficiently businesses can implement new procedures when the time comes, and the faster our recovery will be. But Canadians are still waiting. In the absence of a cohesive plan to help businesses jump-start the economy, the toll of this third lockdown is shining a light on the chasm between our temporary rebounds and durable, long-term recovery.

In Canada, as of late July, about 20 per cent of cases were in health workers — double the global average. By late January, about 15,000 in Ontario had been infected. At least 30 had died of the virus. Rates are higher in MDs than in other health professionals.

Some 58 per cent of Canadian workers lack adequate sick leave. The new Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit pays $450 per week after taxes for up to two weeks, even to self-employed workers. Alberta has recently added an extra $625 after a 14-day period of quarantine. Unlike for paid sick days, persons must apply for a payment, it reimburses less than the minimum wage, does not cover those who wish a shorter leave and payment may take several weeks. These amounts are still inadequate to replace the lost income of physicians, most nurses and many other health professionals. More is needed if they are to be deterred from working; thus additional federal support is required.
Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister stated several months ago, “We want to encourage people not to work when they are ill and we want to make sure that they are not hurt financially.” His province has just agreed to provide major support to MDs for up to 20 days per year if they are forced to self-isolate or contract the coronavirus.
Most physicians are self-employed and rely on private insurance, but those older than age 65 generally cannot qualify. For most, there is a waiting period of at least two weeks.
Most provinces have recognized this fact. Saskatchewan, most other provinces, and the Yukon all cover their MDs for lost income from day one of self-isolation or illness. Most British Columbia MDs had been covered (up to age 70) by a government-funded disability plan. Those that were not, for months have been covered for quarantine or COVID-19 illness from day one. Only Alberta and Ontario have left their physicians financially unprotected."

Article content On Tuesday, Joe Biden accused Texas Republicans of being behind “ the most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War. ” In Texas, as with other states, GOP legislators convened to pass a law mandating voters show valid photo ID when they show up to vote. Democrats, meanwhile, packed up and flocked on private jets to Washington, D.C., to deny them quorum. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Back to video Across America, “voting rights” have become the top political issue after the contested 2020 election. After courts dismissed their claims, states where results were challenged — Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin — have passed measures for election security, requiring photo ID to ensure that only eligible citizens vote. Eighty per cent of Americans, in a recent Monmouth University Poll, support these measures , with 69 per cent of Black voters endorsing the same . Though the U.S. Supreme Court recently upheld these laws, 6-3, in Arizona, Democrats are undeterred to “stop the steal.” Their ‘For the People Act,’ pending in Congress, would override state election security and end all ID requirements. So far, the Senate filibuster has prevented it from becoming law.

Article content While the U.S. bickers over “election security,” however, it may be worthwhile to look northward to the Canadian example. In 2007, with the Harper government’s Bill C-31 amendments to the Elections Act, Canada made government-issued voter ID compulsory for federal elections (with provinces having similar measures). Voters, per Section 143, are required to prove their identity and residence, with strict requirements for the kinds of ID acceptable. Photo ID is the main type. Alternatively, voters require double ID — both proving their address — or must (along with another known voter) attest to their eligibility, which is confirmed later. To these rules, there are no exceptions — regardless of race, income or gender.

Article content 'Voting rights' have become the top political issue These measures have long been supported by Canadians and have been in place without issue. In 2019, during our most recent federal election, I was hired by Elections Canada to serve as Deputy Returning Officer for an inner-city Toronto riding. From dawn to dusk, my job was to verify voters’ ID, monitor the ballot box, ensure ballot security and count the votes after the polls closed. The downtown riding spanned all socio-economic groups — from tony homes to homeless shelters and encampments — with many ethnic minorities. Regardless of their background or identity, every one of the voters I serviced presented valid voter ID to cast their ballot. Virtually all had government-issued photo ID showing their address — whether a driver’s licence or another card — with the rest coming prepared with two documents to prove their eligibility. Young and old, poor or wealthy, these voters instinctively thought to bring ID with them to the ballot box. Just like driving a car or buying alcohol, they knew that voting must be safe and secure.

Article content Since these laws were made, and four federal elections later, there have never been accusations of “widespread voter fraud” or “stolen elections” on a national scale in Canada. Even in single contested cases, such as former Conservative MP Ted Opitz’s six-vote victory in Etobicoke-Centre in 2011, nobody questioned voters’ identification — though then-Liberal leader Bob Rae’s conspiratorial claims that “ democracy was undermined ” would mirror Donald Trump today. When these voter ID laws were challenged on appeal in 2014 at the B.C. Court of Appeal, in Henry v. Canada (Attorney General), they were upheld unanimously. In her concurrence, Justice Daphne Smith found “ the objectives of preventing voter fraud and maintaining confidence in the electoral system to be pressing and substantial .”

Just wait until the next federal election In short, for over a decade, Canada has run its democracy smoothly with voter ID laws that keep our elections secure. Our insistence on using paper ballots for federal elections and allowing partisan election observers has helped bring in transparency and accountability, ensuring our elections are not compromised. Following Ronald Reagan, we Canadians “trust, but verify.” As an economically, socially and culturally similar state, it thus beggars belief that Democrats in the United States won’t adopt voter ID laws for election security. The idea that low-income ethnic minorities can’t obtain proper ID — required for all the other business of life is, frankly “fake news” spewed by progressives and the mainstream media to alarm voters, and amounts to the soft bigotry of low expectations. Worse, amidst massive illegal immigration and election interference by Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, risks to voter integrity are greater than ever. Even the U.K. recognizes this, and has introduced new voter ID rules for protection . In these times, trying to loosen such laws is at odds with reality. If Joe Biden truly cares about “facts,” then the next time he speaks on voting rights, he’d do well to remember these.

Article content Mandatory public masking has been saving lives and leading to an earlier (and safer) reopening of societies around the world. Despite this, Canadian officials have been reticent to support this cheap, effective measure.

Article content As of May 12, 13 U.S. states, including Illinois, New York and Massachusetts, and 84 countries, including Israel, Germany, Austria, Czechia and France, have laws mandating public masking. And zero Canadian jurisdictions. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

We need mandatory masks laws Back to video We are emerging from a severe lockdown, taking tentative steps into the unknown. Over a period of seven weeks, Canadians have endured the challenges of physical isolation. The pressure to reopen society is immense, but many share our concern that reopening will cause a second wave of cases. Advice for hand hygiene and physical distancing has been widely adopted and accepted. Why not masks? Citing asymptomatic and presymptomatic spread, on April 6 Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief medical officer of health, stated “wearing a non-medical mask … is an additional measure that you can take to protect others around you in situations where physical distancing is difficult.”

Article content This is hardly a rousing endorsement. Similar weak recommendations have come from other public health officials, like Dr. Bonnie Henry of B.C., and Dr. Deena Hinshaw of Alberta. Public health officials presumably aren’t convinced that evidence is strong enough to make a stronger recommendation for universal wear. The gold standard of evidence in medicine is the randomized controlled trial, where two populations are randomly assigned the intervention, and then a measurement of the intervention’s effectiveness is made. Unfortunately, this doesn’t exist for a population-scale intervention like masking. So instead we need to rely on the best available evidence, and the precautionary principle. Michael Ryan of the WHO says: “If you need to be right before you move, you will never win. Perfection is the enemy of the good when it comes to emergency management.”

Article content As we learn more about asymptomatic spread, superspreader events, droplet transmission and the utility of masks as barriers, it is evident that masks play an important role. Countries with mandatory mask laws have seen their curves bend towards zero, contrary to countries with voluntary recommendations such as Canada, the U.K. and the U.S. There are exceptions, such as Iceland, Australia and New Zealand, which have successfully tamped down the curve without mandatory masks. Each has its own story, including massive testing, or extremely early lockdown. But these are few and far between. All of these layers, such as physical distancing, contact tracing, isolation, lockdowns, and masks, act to decrease the R0: the average number of people each viral-shedding person infects. Above 1? The infection grows in a population. Below 1? It shrinks. Scientists believe it could be up to 5.7 in a population without any mitigation measures.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content A recent scientific paper looked at how the combination of a mask’s effectiveness and the proportion of a population wearing it worked to decrease the R0. If the mask is only moderately effective, as in cloth masks, the proportion wearing it needs to be high. For example, a cloth mask, which may only be 60 per cent effective, requires 60 per cent compliance to drop the Ro below one. In a recent poll, abysmally only 33 per cent of Canadians are wearing masks, Quebec being the worst at 24 per cent. Like many previous public health measures such as seatbelts, or bicycle helmets, compliance is poor until legislated. Similarly, if we want people to wear masks, we need them to be mandatory. Another advantage to masks, aside from saving lives, is reopening the economy.

Article content South Korea, Czechia, Austria, China are all countries with mandatory or high levels of mask compliance that have enabled their economies to open up, with minimal increases in COVID mortality. A recent economic analysis of mask use estimated a value of $3,000 to $6,000 to the economy for each mask worn. Possible harm? Literally billions of people are masking in 79 countries around the world without worsening their COVID-19 numbers — good evidence of minimal risk. Multiple provinces are starting to open up their economies. Quebec and Ontario are still in the throes of severe outbreaks. In both situations, mandatory masking will help save lives and prevent a recurrence, providing a massive return on investment. I protect you, you protect me. We all protect society.

With a positivity rate of 12.3 per cent (13.6 per cent in Winnipeg) earlier this week, it has the highest rate of new COVID-19 cases in North America. Not surprisingly, Winnipeg recently recorded 72 clusters of cases associated with workplaces. Manitoba has transferred over 30 patients to hospitals in Ontario and Saskatchewan. It asked for assistance from the Canadian Armed Forces, and also requested surplus vaccine doses from the United States. Meanwhile, Saskatchewan, B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec have announced reopening plans . Case counts across Canada are down more than 50 per cent since mid-April. About half of Canadians have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Some two-thirds of those over age 18 in Saskatchewan have received their first dose of vaccine; the number in hospital due to COVID-19 is the lowest since late November. Yet one can never let down one’s guard. Consider the recent unexpected surges in cases in Vietnam, Taiwan and Singapore. If periods of lockdowns are to be shortened and recurrent waves of this and any future pandemics avoided, the premiers must use all the potential tools in their toolboxes. This requires increased rapid testing and contact tracing, adequate paid sick benefits, greatly enhanced temporary funding from Ottawa and much better federal-provincial cooperation — not the current patchwork of plans.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content Prior to the pandemic, only two provinces mandated paid sick leave: in Quebec, two paid sick days per year and in Prince Edward Island one day. Ontario used to require two days, but this was repealed by Premier Doug Ford in 2018. New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador still provide no paid sick benefits. Quebec is the only province with paid family leave and which provides a financial benefit of $575 per week to workers forced to isolate because they have COVID-19 or have been in contact with a positive case. PEI has a temporary fund which reimburses employers or self-employed persons up to $160 per day for six days to attend a vaccination, for testing, illness, or self-isolation. For many months, Premiers Doug Ford and Jason Kenney argued that the problems were a poor supply of vaccines and a lack of border controls — both due to the federal government. They were only partly correct, and ignored the problem of workplace infection, over which they do have some control. For months, Ford had refused to consider provincial sick leave, but relied on the federal Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit. However, the CRSB pays only $450 per week after taxes (less than minimum wage), persons must apply every week, it does not cover shorter leave times, and remittance may take several weeks. As the CRSB was not improved in the new federal budget, Ontario announced that it would finally consider a supplemental provincial program. It initially proposed to double the CRSB to $1,000 per week before taxes, and cover 100 per cent of the increased cost but Ottawa balked. Ford then provided three paid sick days. Businesses would pay up to $200 per day, and be reimbursed by the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board.

Article content In early May, Manitoba announced a program that would provide employers with up to $600 per employee for up to five days. British Columbia then agreed to reimburse employers up to $200 per day for three days. Shortly thereafter, Nova Scotia initiated a plan that would cover businesses and the self-employed, and pay up to $160 per day for four days. The Yukon now pays $378 daily up to 10 days. In Alberta, the government will cover three hours of paid leave when persons are vaccinated, and self-isolation support with room, board and a payment of $625, for a total value of $2,000. However, in all provinces, sick employees when needing 10-14 days off would also have to apply for the federal CRSB, with all its faults. Thus, obtaining access to adequate paid sick leave would be overly complicated across Canada. All governments should collaborate and Ottawa needs to provide better funding and simplicity. Isolating workers would continue to be paid through their employer, who would be reimbursed by the provincial government, which would eventually be paid by Ottawa. Scott Moe and the other premiers should mandate sufficient paid sick leave for all workers. Ottawa should immediately agree to reimburse provinces and territories for funding businesses and the self-employed for this leave. It should also pay provinces and territories to provide adequate sick benefits to MDs, nurses, and other health professionals, especially while they are awaiting to be fully vaccinated.

Article content As COVID-19 cases soar in Alberta, with the province now accounting for nearly 25 per cent of all active cases in Canada, Premier Jason Kenney appeared on a popular South Asian radio station in Calgary, calling for the South Asian community to do more to bring down surging infection rates.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content According to Kenney, the South Asian community is responsible for the rapid rise in COVID-19 cases in Alberta, zeroing in on northeast Calgary, an area with a significant South Asian population, for having a particularly high number of COVID-19 cases.

Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: Kenney should blame his inaction for COVID surge, not South Asian community Back to video While Kenney tried to assure listeners that he doesn’t mean to blame or target any particular individual or community, his message misses the mark. While the community is diverse, a large proportion of Albertans of South Asian descent are employed in essential frontline services and do not have the privilege of being able to work from home. They are grocery-store workers, transit operators, and truck drivers; they are the nurses, health-care aides, and support staff in clinics, hospitals, and long-term care homes. Along with an increased risk of exposure to COVID-19, many have limited employment benefits and access to compensated sick leave. South Asians are also more likely to live in multigenerational housing. Often, this is a result of financial constraints that are more likely to be faced by recent immigrants.

Article content Many within the South Asian community are on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic response. For the premier to selectively call out and chastise the South Asian community for seemingly shirking their responsibility in this pandemic betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the different structural factors that shape how COVID-19 disproportionately impacts certain communities. It further perpetuates unfair and harmful narratives of the community. In reality, the reason for the rise in COVID-19 rates in Alberta over the past month has been the Kenney government’s relative inaction in the face of a worsening pandemic. Kenney’s refusal to implement appropriate public health restrictions is the reason for the rapid spread of the virus, not South Asian culture.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content Alberta is currently the only jurisdiction in Canada that has not introduced a provincewide mask mandate. Even in the face of a broken contact tracing system, Kenney refuses to adopt the federal contact tracing app, citing the monstrous challenge of deleting the provincial app and downloading a different one. When Alberta physicians called for a two-week “circuit breaker” lockdown to limit the strain of the virus on the health-care system, Kenney responded with the closure of group yoga and spin classes. Over the weekend, hundreds of maskless Albertans took to the streets to participate in anti-mask demonstrations in Edmonton, Calgary, and Red Deer. Even though current provincial regulations limit outdoor gatherings to 10 people, Calgary police officers watched from a distance. While Kenney delivered a reprimanding “wake-up call” to South Asians, threatening the community with policing and monetary fines, he refused to condemn these anti-mask rallies. It is clear that for Kenney, the right to protest trumps Albertans’ right to safety and health. Rather than scapegoat a community that has done much to combat the COVID-19 pandemic — from staffing hospitals to cleaning schools to driving buses — the provincial government would far better serve Albertans by prioritizing a pandemic response based on public health, not on ideology. While efforts to combat the virus are our collective responsibility, it starts at the top.

Opinion: We are infectious disease experts. It's time to lift the COVID-19 lockdowns Canada needs a hospital capacity-based approach to guide local lifting and reintroduction of restrictive measures as necessary
Article content By Neil Rau, Susan Richardson, Martha Fulford and Dominik Mertz The past two months have shown that with major sacrifices, the community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus could be slowed down. In Canada, we can rightfully say that we were able to “flatten the curve” to avert a northern Italy or New York City scenario. Now we face the unintended consequences: delays in medical care for non-COVID-19 patients, educational impacts, the looming pandemic of mental-health issues, and massive economic repercussions. Widespread restrictions certainly cannot be sustained until an effective and safe vaccine is widely available, which may not occur for years, if ever. And the virus is unlikely to disappear from Canada or the world any time soon. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Article content Did the lockdown achieve the desired goals? Yes and no. Success in “flattening” the outbreak curve permitted the health-care system to handle the surge in cases safely and to avoid unnecessary deaths. But, we were not successful in protecting the elderly and frail population in nursing homes, where roughly 80 per cent of Canada’s deaths occurred. It is important to point out that more than 95 per cent of COVID-19 deaths occurred in those over 60, compared with none under age 20. Protection of the former group deserves the most attention; this will be easier if limited resources are diverted from other, low-risk groups. In Canada, the individual rate of death from COVID-19 for people under 65 years of age is six per million people, or 0.0006 per cent. This is roughly equivalent to the risk of dying from a motor vehicle accident during the same time period. In other countries where data are available, 0.6-2.6 per cent of deaths in people below age 65 have occurred in people without known underlying health conditions. Although the risk of death is small in this group, ongoing research to discover the critical risk factors for death from COVID-19 in younger age groups must remain a top priority. This will permit us to better protect those at risk, while loosening restrictions for the majority.

Article content The virus is unlikely to disappear from Canada or the world any time soon It is also time to continue releasing lockdown measures. Remember, the original approach of “flattening the curve” was to relax restrictions if the system was not overwhelmed. That is still the appropriate goal. It is unlikely that zero infections can be achieved for COVID-19, which fundamentally spreads like influenza or the common cold, including from those without symptoms. The virus causes disease so mild in many people that it can circulate without detection, until it is introduced into a vulnerable population. While some advocate waiting for a vaccine, that would mean continuation of a lockdown for an unknown period of time. This approach ignores how complicated and difficult vaccine development can be. It is entirely possible that in two years we will still not have a vaccine, and very probable that a vaccine will not eliminate the virus entirely. Hence, we need to come to terms with the fact that we cannot eliminate this virus. At best, we can continue to slow its spread, and protect the frail and elderly.

Article content Governments now propose that we test and trace all contacts of identified cases of disease. As we embark on this stage, we will find cases that would previously have gone unnoticed. Ironically, the better our testing capacity and the more we look, the more we will find, making it appear that disease is worsening, when it isn’t. This is particularly problematic as restrictions are being lifted. Should we automatically reinstate restrictions when the number of cases increases? No. Instead we should use local hospital capacity as the guiding principle, ensuring that all patients who need hospital or ICU care can get it. This is not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution: what happens in an urban centre is different from what happens in smaller cities or rural areas of Canada.

Article content Photo by Gavin Young/Postmedia News We need a tailored regional approach if the local hospital system gets strained. Germany, for example, chose a local threshold of 50 new cases per 100,000 population per week for when reinstitution of lockdown measures must be considered based on local capacity. The Ontario equivalent using the same threshold would be 7,300 new cases per week, or 1,043 per day. In contrast, Ontario has recommended a much lower provincewide threshold of 200 new community cases of infections per day as a threshold for action. This is based on an estimate of the ability of the system to accommodate the required contact tracing for every diagnosed case at the provincial level. The number of community cases should not be the metric of choice for relaxing restrictions as it is not a reflection of the more critical measure, hospital capacity. In addition, time spent on contact tracing is neither necessary nor feasible for all community cases, as it misses asymptomatic and covert transmission. Instead, testing and contact tracing should be focused mainly on hospitals and long-term care institutions, where the impacts of disease are the highest.

Article content Accepting ongoing sustainable levels of transmission might be a healthier option in the long term. While the lockdown has decreased transmission of the virus in the short run, it has also prevented the development of population immunity in low-risk people. We should embrace the benefits of the development of immunity in a growing segment of the population. Right now, the only means of achieving this is by natural infection. Recent data suggests that the human body reacts no differently to this virus than to other respiratory viruses: it mounts immunity, and once achieved, the virus gets cleared and there is protection from future infection. Given the novelty of the virus we do not have long-term data, but we know from 2003 SARS that immunity may last up to 13 years. Once a vaccine is available that would be the preferred option. However, there is no guarantee of whether and when a vaccine will be available, or how effective it will be, to say nothing of how broad the uptake of it will be in the population.

Article content Photo by David Kawai/Bloomberg Will this approach cost more deaths? Sweden, which allowed for more community transmission, is the measure of this strategy. More deaths per capita did occur than in Canada. On the positive side, Sweden’s number of new cases has peaked and Sweden will be better protected against future waves and the need for future restrictions. In the absence of a vaccine, it is a question of paying now or paying later. While the realistic goal of Canada’s lockdown was to delay deaths, it was never going to avoid them entirely. One year from now, Canada and Sweden may well have the same number of deaths per capita, but Canada may have had significantly more economic and social impacts. Canada needs a model that uses a hospital capacity-based approach to guide local lifting and reintroduction of more restrictive measures, as necessary. In the absence of hospital strain, consider continuing with a swift release of lockdown measures, to include opening of elementary schools, playgrounds, workplaces, stores and restaurants, while following basic physical distancing rules and voluntary limitations to social gatherings, while continuing to ban mass gatherings and protecting the elderly and those at highest risk.

Some people did offer reasonable opinions critiquing specific COVID-19 rules. Canada certainly had some bizarre enforcement around that time, like the story of a by-law officer who paid a visit to an Ottawa father who was playing alone with his autistic son in an empty park.

Article content We have now endured close to seven months of this pandemic, the likes of which almost no one in the world has seen in their lifetime. In this short period of time, we have seen staggering developments on the research front — knowledge that continues to accumulate to this day. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.
tap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: How we can keep COVID down using 'the Hammer and the Dance' Back to video Looking back to March when much of Canada entered a lockdown, though things have not been perfect, our overall response was successful. We now have very low levels of disease transmission across the country, and are currently in the midst of a slow, deliberate return to something closer to normalcy. This process is a complicated one, which at times may result in us having to re-evaluate our progress. At this phase in the outbreak it is safe to say we have passed the first wave. We now must recalibrate our goals and expectations during this pre-vaccine era to a world living with COVID-19, albeit one where we continue to strive to keep rates of infection as low as possible in community settings. There are four important concepts to consider in the coming months.

Article content The Hammer and the Dance Tomás Pueyo wrote a prescient article in March referring to a phased approach to controlling and maintaining the outbreak that he called “The Hammer and the Dance.” The “hammer” aims to get the rate of COVID-19 transmission as low as possible, as quickly as possible, accomplished through the lockdown imposed back in March. This eventually worked, bringing us to low levels of disease transmission across the country. We are currently in the “dance” phase where the goal is to preserve this low transmission, aiming for a reproductive “Rt” rate (how many people on average an infected person passes the virus to) below one. Photo by Elliot Ferguson/The Whig-Standard/Postmedia Network Here, we dance with the virus by closely monitoring transmission, responding to outbreaks quickly to quell the small fires before they become big ones, and apply future policy based on the lessons learned from these events. During this “dance” phase, we should expect outbreaks. They will happen. Rapid identification of these is a sign that our system is working. Take for instance the recent outbreak at a nail salon in Kingston, Ont. Public health quickly reacted to the outbreak, with rapid case detection, contact tracing and focused isolation. Outbreak control was swift and effective.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content This process of rapidly responding to outbreaks is used by countries that have successfully managed their epidemics and have the infection under relatively good control. With early detection systems, and sufficient testing capacity, we are afforded the ability to identify outbreaks early, and if needed, reintroduce public health measures with precision, rather than globally. Remember the Big Picture Across Canada, there are news reports giving us daily COVID-19 case counts. More often than not, words like “spike,” “uptick” and “surge” are deployed when there are more cases today than yesterday, and “plummet,” “dip” and “drop” when fewer. These terms provoke undue anxiety or relief, but in reality all miss the big picture. Like the stock market, a clearer idea is obtained by looking at the longer-term trends, such as seven-day averages, in addition to other metrics.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content Whether there are 170 cases today, 130 tomorrow and 190 the day after does not matter as much as the fact that this is lower than the 400 cases a day from a month earlier. The situation has greatly improved in Canada with each successive month, and this is only appreciated when looking past the proverbial trees to the forest. Photo by Graham Hughes / The Canadian Press This is where the Rt rate is a useful metric. The goal is to keep this number at or below one to ensure cases are stable or declining over time, and at present, this is where we are in most of Canada. This value, however, can be misleading when there are a low number of cases. As the number of cases decrease below a certain threshold, small changes result in relatively large swings of the Rt, which leads to anxiety around explosive growth in localized regions. Once again, it is important to not look at one value in isolation; rather a compilation of metrics over time to gain a more holistic and accurate picture.

Article content Explosive growth does not happen overnight On Feb. 18, in northern Italy, the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in a healthy 38-year-old male. He was dubbed “Patient 1.” A short time thereafter, this area of Italy experienced an explosion of COVID-19 cases that overwhelmed the health-care system, sickened thousands of people including hundreds of health-care workers, and took weeks to get under control. Looking closer, Patient 1 was more likely Patient 100, or possibly Patient 1,000. When all eyes were on China in early 2020, COVID-19 was already circulating in northern Italy. It took weeks of undetected (and therefore uncontrolled) spread before the country was in the grips of the explosive epidemic growth. By that point, even with extreme measures such as a lockdown, things got a lot worse before they eventually got better.

Article content Photo by Marco Alpozzi/LaPresse In Canada, our measures, including the lockdown, were able to largely avoid this terrible scenario, but there is still fear it could happen if we get complacent with our public-health measures such as physical distancing, indoor mask wearing and good hand hygiene. This concern has been magnified across the country in the last few weeks, with multiple regions relaxing restrictions along with increasing outbreak clusters. These clusters, however, do not progress to exponential growth overnight. To have a scenario akin to what happened in northern Italy or New York City, you would need weeks of uncontrolled spread. With our current testing capacity and availability, as well our ability to track, trace and isolate clusters, this is an unlikely scenario here in Canada.

Article content We may get clusters of infection and provinces may even need to walk back on some of the reopening plans if there are a large number of cases, but this would happen long before we ever get to a situation of exponential growth overwhelming our health-care systems. Nevertheless, it is imperative to continue practising the principles of COVID-19 prevention including physical distancing, good hand hygiene and masks in indoor public places. Low community transmission means a lower risk for everyone Dr. Mike Ryan of the World Health Organization recently, and very insightfully, remarked that the best way we can protect people against COVID-19 is by having low community transmission. This obvious point cannot be emphasized enough. When there is a low burden of COVID-19 in a given area, the risk of acquisition will be substantially reduced for everyone, and for every activity. It is only under these low-burden circumstances where allowing higher-risk venues (such as schools, indoor dining, bars, etc.) to even be considered for reopening.

Article content Photo by JONATHAN NACKSTRAND/AFP These decisions, given the protection from low prevalence environments, cannot be applied in a subjective manner. Evenly distributed as well as evidence-based infection and control policies should be applied to most settings with a goal to give institutions and businesses a chance to open up safely while community transmission is low. Today in Canada, the chance you have of contracting COVID-19 in the community, though not zero, is the lowest it has been since the start of the pandemic. This is the time to arm ourselves with the power and courage to cautiously lift restrictions on higher-risk activities, without descending into an explosion of cases, with the understanding that this reopening may be reversed if (or when) case numbers rise.

Article content A Final Thought By this point, it should come as no shock that COVID-19 will be a significant part of our everyday lives for some time to come. Many things have changed in a dramatic way, and some may never be the same again. A vaccine and/or effective treatment cannot come soon enough. Canadians have come together at great personal sacrifice to endure a lockdown, and ultimately the first phase was successful. There is a very understandable reluctance to lift restrictions for fear of a resurgence, but if anything, now is the time to do it with careful planning and monitoring, and with a goal to keep community cases as low as possible.

Opinion on COVID-19: These epidemiologists say let’s think about reopening daycares and elementary schools In contact tracing from China, Korea and elsewhere, epidemiologists have found few instances of children being part of a transmission chain
Article content By Jay S. Kaufman and Joanna Merckx We are both epidemiologists, and one of us specializes in pediatric infectious diseases. Confined at home with our small children running amok, we are acutely aware of the impact on families of the lockdown to “flatten the curve” of the current pandemic. The characteristics and transmission dynamics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus (which causes the disease known as COVID-19) still remain largely unknown. But as new epidemiologic information does become available, it is important to reassess the complex social policies that were enacted to save lives, protect our health-care system and at the same time minimize collateral damage to families and civil society.

Article content Over 90 per cent of students worldwide have now been affected by pandemic-related school closures. A few countries are now cautiously reopening schools and others plan to do so in coming weeks. Ontario, meanwhile, has recently extended its closure, as have many U.S. states. As parents struggle to supervise and educate children at home and teachers are concerned for their workplace safety, we need to consider the important possibility that children may in fact play a limited role in passing the virus to others. Given their gregarious and unhygienic habits, children are often assumed to be important conduits of infectious disease. This is clearly true for influenza, which helps explain the common presumption that children ought to be important drivers of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well. In fact, there is little evidence this is so and plenty of reason to doubt it.

Article content In the case of SARS-CoV-2, a review of household transmission clusters found that a possible pediatric initial case was present in less than 10 per cent of investigated household clusters. This is in stark contrast to other epidemics, such as avian influenza, for which a child was the source of household infection more than half the time. Households are an especially good setting to study how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted because the contact between child and adult members is as close as it can get. Finding a very limited role for children in fuelling the transmission chain within the family suggests that school closures are probably not adding much in the containment of the epidemic. A literature review by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health found only one example for SARS-CoV-2 where a small child might have infected his parents.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content Photo by China Daily/Reuters A number of mathematical models of the COVID-19 epidemic also support the conjecture that transmission of the virus from children is rare or absent. In places where schools remained open, such as Iceland, there is no evidence they were important places of transmission. One detailed investigation of an infected nine-year-old boy in France did not detect a single secondary case after he had contact with 112 peers and adults at three different schools during his symptomatic period. The currently available literature , though still quite limited, therefore supports the theory that children pass on the infection rarely if at all. If it is true that children do not contribute importantly to the propagation of the epidemic, it’s likely that school closures have a minimal impact on controlling the virus. But they do clearly have profound effects on the workforce and on the health of children and parents. Among other things, they exacerbate child obesity , household violence and intellectual setbacks for children missing out on educational content . Children with special needs are most severely affected. They are cut off from professional management and institutional resources, while school closure for children living in poor or marginalized households exacerbates existing inequalities .

Article content A number of models of the epidemic support the conjecture that transmission of the virus from children is rare or absent We must stress that when we refer to children we mean those of elementary-school age and younger. Though teens and adolescents have their own specific vulnerabilities and struggles with the limitations imposed by lockdowns, there is evidence that their role in transmission parallels that of adults . For children in high school and university, going back to school will be therefore be more complicated, potentially requiring greater use of physical distancing, hand hygiene and masks. The same holds true for inevitable social and professional interactions between parents and other adults in all school environments. If schools are open, teachers will commute to work and interact with each other, requiring additional hygiene and distancing measures to ensure their health and safety.

Article content SARS-CoV-2 has only circulated in human populations for a few months and much remains to be learned about its transmission and prevention. But already there is substantial reason to suspect that young children are not major contributors to the COVID-19 epidemic and may not need to be kept from school any longer. If we can allow a safe and carefully managed return, this would be a great relief to both children and parents.

To date, over 8,000 Canadians have lost their lives, 8.4 million have accessed emergency income supports, countless businesses have had their viability threatened and our 2021 federal budget deficit will likely exceed $250 billion — increasing our total federal debt by 35 per cent in just one year.

Article content Photo by Heiko Junge/NTB Scanpix/AFP The all-important process of contact tracing and notifying people who may have been exposed is labour intensive and subject to several practical limitations. A public health worker must interview each person who tests positive to find everyone that person might have infected. Success depends on those who test positive remembering, and willingly disclosing, every contact. Public health officials then get on the phone to find and notify each person on that list. Canadians know that exposure notification is important. The senators’ survey found that 82 per cent of Canadians want to be automatically notified if they are exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 and 92 per cent want others to be automatically notified if they test positive.

Article content An exposure notification app can enable complete and speedy notification, while limiting the amount of private information that must be disclosed. This is because recent software designs keep the contact data on the user’s phone until, with the user’s permission, public health officials trigger the anonymous digital notification of all those who came into close proximity with the infected person over a certain period of time. This differs from most commercial apps that transfer location information to centralized servers. Photo by Fabrice COFFRINI/AFP Wide adoption of an exposure notification app among the 87 per cent of Canadians who have smartphones would strengthen traditional public health efforts. However, these apps have been launched in several countries and some have had lacklustre results. In early April, Iceland introduced an app just as it flattened its curve. It had limited effect because it was downloaded by only 38 per cent of the population. Singapore was even lower, at 20 per cent.

Article content Just like a vaccine, an app requires a high level of adoption to provide the greatest benefits, but, unlike a vaccine, an exposure notification app is available today. Additionally, it was concerning that only 63 per cent of Canadians said that they would take a vaccine without hesitation once it’s available. A recent Journal of the American Medical Association article argued that the COVID-19 pandemic could be suppressed if traditional methods were augmented by at least 56 per cent of the population using one contact-tracing app. If governments in Canada co-operate and focus their efforts on the adoption of one national contact-tracing app, they’ll find a lot of talented entrepreneurs who are willing to help earn the public’s trust.

Article content Photo by Paresh Dave/Reuters Recently, Health Minister Patty Hajdu told reporters that “some jurisdictions prefer” that contact tracing be done “the old-fashioned way.” That’s worrisome given recent data showing that 46 per cent of COVID-19 transmissions occur pre-symptomatically, meaning before the individual would normally get tested. The authors concluded that supplementing traditional contact tracing with digital apps was an essential prevention measure. In the words of Dr. Michael Warner, medical director of critical care at Michael Garron Hospital in Toronto, “every minute counts” when tracking down the contacts of people infected with COVID-19. That’s why it’s imperative that politicians and public health officials in all provinces work together in advance of a second wave of COVID-19, to encourage the widespread adoption of one national exposure notification app to augment traditional contact-tracing efforts.

Article content In mid-March, for the first time in history, Canada went into lockdown as part of a desperate effort to control a novel pathogen. It is now late November and we are deep into the second wave. Long-term care facilities, though better protected since the first wave, are once again dealing with COVID-19 outbreaks and deaths. Admissions to hospitals, including intensive-care units, are piling on the back of a chronically overloaded health-care system. But despite this scenario being reminiscent of March, the current situation has some important differences, and much of that is due to our greater knowledge of the virus itself. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

We all saw the fearsome images from Wuhan, China, Bergamo, Italy, and New York City. We pulled together, united and denied the virus much of its fuel — we closed everything but the essentials, in order to protect ourselves and our health-care system from being overwhelmed. And while the health-care system was not stretched beyond capacity, marginalized communities were disproportionately impacted by these restrictions.

Article content Now, polarization is creeping into some of our national and provincial conversations, as public health measures are increasingly perceived on a spectrum ranging from “unfortunately necessary” to “useless and damaging.” As the pandemic drags on, the incentive to adhere to life-disrupting public health guidance may seem less and less relevant, especially to individuals who believe the risk they face is minimal. Further complicating matters is the fact that core components of our pandemic response require attention, including boosting our test-and-trace systems and offering better supports for those who are disproportionately impacted by both the virus and the policies designed to curb it. Emerging vaccine data provides a glimpse into a much brighter future, with roll-out expected to begin in the first quarter of 2021. But we first need to safely navigate the challenging winter months ahead. No radical paradigm shifts are necessary; we just need to focus on the fundamental tenets of our epidemic response and integrate the lessons that have been learned in Canada and abroad. This involves strengthening policies that will drive case numbers down, doing everything possible to maintain lower levels of community transmission, better protecting vulnerable populations and preventing our health-care system from being overwhelmed.

Article content There are four key principles that we need to focus on during the months ahead. First, we need measures to reduce nonessential indoor interactions, as well as protect schools and essential workplaces. This is a job not just for public health officials, but for individuals, as well. We need to limit our overall indoor interactions with non-household members during high transmission periods, which will help lower community transmission. For our essential interactions, we should prioritize indoor masking, distancing, ventilation and hand-washing. We also need to do a better job of protecting essential workplaces, hospitals and schools. Second, we need to support essential workers and marginalized communities. Many essential workers cannot work from home. They are involved in food services, caring professions, transport and infrastructure work — all jobs that directly support Canadian society. These individuals require safe workplaces, with universal indoor masking, physical distancing, ventilation and safe places to take breaks. Essential workers should have easy access to paid sick leave, which minimizes financial instability when symptomatic or exposed, and subsequently reduces workplace transmission. Access to facilities where people with large households can safely isolate should also be readily available. Supporting worker safely will reduce transmission and reduce pandemic-related disruptions to workplaces.

Article content Third, we must strengthen our testing, tracing, isolation and support systems. Every symptomatic person should be able to easily access testing, and receive timely results and guidance. Public health units require infrastructure and personnel to bolster their contact-tracing systems, which will help protect at-risk individuals, reduce community transmission and better inform our public health response. The appropriate use of rapid tests should be prioritized in high-risk areas, such as long-term care homes and remote communities. These rapid tests may not rule out all infection, but positive tests could help identify contagious individuals who should then isolate. Finally, governments must recognize the importance of community engagement and communication. Meaningfully engaging communities and providing information that is age, language and culturally appropriate, through conventional and social media platforms, will help communities understand and adapt to policy measures, drive positive behavioural change and help keep our communities safe.

Article content None of the aforementioned measures are new, and all of them have been implemented across Canada to varying degrees. Sticking with this blueprint, and improving how we implement it, will guide us safely into the vaccine era. The initial batch of vaccines is expected to reduce overall deaths and decrease health-care utilization, even if a relatively small initial supply is prioritized for those who face the greatest risk of severe infection. As vaccination campaigns expand, population vaccine-induced immunity will be the major milestone on our march back to normalcy. In the meantime, we need to double down on our public health efforts, and increase the consistency of our federal, provincial, municipal and individual responses, in order to lower rates of transmission and keep them low. There is no magic to this process, just continued adherence to the core principles of public health and epidemic management, providing support for impacted groups, engaging communities and communicating effectively.

While this was somewhat predictable as more people gather in indoor settings, it is clearly vital to ensure the cases do not get out of control. Let’s be clear: Canada cannot afford a second lockdown. The emotional and financial impact of physical distancing measures have exacted a heavy toll. In May more than half of respondents to a Statistics Canada online questionnaire reported worsening mental health. Unicef Canada has warned of a “socioeconomic crisis” affecting children through physical-distancing control measures. Across the country many thousands of small businesses have closed permanently, while others are hanging on by a thread.

Article content Let’s be clear: Canada cannot afford a second lockdown Since the beginning of the pandemic we have emphasized three Cs: a consistent approach to dealing with the virus, clarity around public health guidelines, and compliance with those rules to keep the virus in check. To those we can add one more C: context. While case numbers and trends are important, contextualizing those numbers is equally important. Let’s put to work the local and global knowledge we have gained over the past eight months. Yes, individuals need to wear masks in indoor public places, maintain two-metre distancing wherever possible, and follow other local public health guidelines. But they also need much more information than they are currently receiving. Public health agencies should be more transparent about where outbreaks are occurring in communities to help inform the general public. Do today’s numbers represent new outbreaks or existing ones? Is the source of infection known or unknown? How efficiently is contact-tracing taking place? Who is getting infected and where? What can we learn from these outbreaks?

Article content Photo by Cole Burston/Bloomberg Rather than lockdowns, it is not too late for data-driven and targeted public health responses to curb the rise in COVID-19 cases. So how can we best contain the outbreaks we are seeing? First, we need to focus on where the outbreaks are occurring and what is driving them, and we need high-quality data to so. Is it a long-term care home? A private party? An apartment building? A bar? Each of those examples requires a different public health response. By drilling down on the source of infection, public health officials can target outbreaks with appropriate interventions without shutting down entire communities. We need to focus on where the outbreaks are occurring Second, our battle against the virus has demonstrated the importance of robust testing and tracing. The sooner test results are available, the faster contact tracing can occur, and the faster outbreaks can be contained. We are still failing on this score. As Dr. David Naylor, co-chair of Canada’s COVID-19 Immunity Task Force recently noted, “We need to have our A-game here in testing and tracing.” That means significantly increased testing capacity (including early detections systems within at-risk groups), and faster results, with positive cases rapidly linked to effective contact tracing. And for those who may not have the resources to self isolate safely, safe havens to recover where people will not infect others .

Article content In our December paper published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, we argued for a “No More Waves” strategy to follow an immediate period of strong suppression to keep the COVID-19 case count low. Our argument is based on balancing health, economic and social risks. It does not imply a zero-case count, but suggests keeping cases sufficiently low to stop further waves.

Article content Under this model, rather than going through economically costly yo-yos with incremental openings and lockdowns, communities would be able to open on an ongoing basis after an initial, sustained lockdown to suppress the virus and stop the spread. We know Canadians are getting tired of policies encroaching on their freedoms, but avoiding further waves is the best approach to manage health, economic and social risks. Below, we provide a compass to enable the relaxation of health rules and limit the possibility of another wave. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: A 'No More Waves' strategy to help minimize the effects of COVID Back to video Hospitalization and mortality counts have sadly risen over the past two months. Now we are starting to see some success after governments took actions in December to suppress the spread of the virus. Those restrictions are starting to come off recently, as case counts have dropped. However, it is too early to declare victory. Imported variants have already shown up in Canada, and they are more transmissible and possibly more deadly. Our vaccination program will optimistically lead to herd immunity by the fall, if vaccine delivery and distribution go as planned and vaccines remain effective against the circulating strains. None of this is a slam dunk, and new waves could easily appear beforehand.

Article content That makes our “No More Waves” strategy as relevant today as when we first proposed it before the winter holidays. This strategy includes three basic elements: (i) strengthened enforcement of health interventions to contain transmission; (ii) evidence-based reduction of gatherings based on transmission, social and economic risks; and (iii) ramping up infrastructure required for COVID-19 surveillance, screening and testing (including supporting wide-scale rapid testing) with accompanying contract tracing and isolation. Compared to the current mitigation strategy, a “No More Waves” strategy would reduce the overall need for prolonged lockdowns and economic, as well as social, hardship. Canada’s four Atlantic provinces, which represent roughly seven per cent of Canada’s population, originally pursued a maximum suppression strategy that later enabled people to have more freedom of movement without facing health risks. Importantly, the economic and social effects of the pandemic largely reflect the spread of the pandemic. Avoiding the exponential growth of cases, therefore, offers the best opportunity to preserve economic and social activity until vaccinations have been broadly administered.

Article content Although prolonged lockdowns are necessary when the realities of exponential growth have overwhelmed other non-pharmacologic interventions (NPIs), they are unneeded in regions where the incidence has not outstripped public health and health-care capacity. The choice of public health measures is determined by: a) the quality of the test-trace-isolate-support system; b) the rate of desired decline in cases; and c) the acceptability of the proposed public health measures. Different NPIs have different predicted effects. Whereas one jurisdiction may choose to go into lockdown for six weeks to drive cases to a low number as quickly as possible, another jurisdiction might choose to close restaurants, bars, fitness facilities and non-essential shopping for 10 weeks to achieve the same effect. The presence of new, highly transmissible variants likely change this calculus, but choosing the interventions should be based on local epidemiology, context and preferences, and should consider the health, economic and social impact of the interventions.

Article content We suggest prioritizing NPIs that are most likely to reduce the spread, while having a lower overall impact on economic and social well-being. Those NPIs that have high economic and social impacts but relatively low effects on transmission should be avoided. For example, we obviously were not going to close grocery and drug stores, given how essential they are, despite some health risk. Similarly, it is our contention that school closures, especially at the primary level, should be considered a last resort. As transmission falls, further steps can be made to open up economies such as low-density gym, manufacturing and retail business openings. Those interventions that have a large impact on transmission but have relatively small economic and social effects (e.g., universal masking and prohibitions on small indoor gatherings, non-essential travel and mass events), would be preferentially employed.

"Alberta sees shift in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, resistance as rollout continues",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-alberta-sees-shift-in-covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy-resistance-as-rollout/,www.theglobeandmail.com,The shift shows that many people’s opinions on the COVID-19 vaccine are not rigid – an important understanding as we near the end of the first vaccine rollout,['Kelly Cryderman'],2021-05-21 19:58:23,"People line up outside an immunization clinic in Edmonton to get their Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine on April 20, 2021.JASON FRANSON/The Canadian Press
If Alberta is starting to crawl out of an awful third wave of the pandemic, it’s in part because provincial vaccine hesitancy and flat-out resistance have evolved with remarkable speed over the past six months.
The shift shows that many people’s opinions on the COVID-19 vaccine are not rigid – an important understanding as we near the end of the first vaccine rollout, when public-health officials are increasing their efforts to reach people who are indifferent, hesitant or resistant.
Last November, one in four Albertans told the Angus Reid Institute they would not get a COVID-19 vaccination – nearly double the percentage of that in Ontario and British Columbia. The polling firm recorded the same percentage at a startling 36 per cent in Alberta in January. Another 9 per cent of Albertans said that month they weren’t sure one way or the other.
Canada vaccine tracker: How many COVID-19 doses have been administered so far?

Coronavirus tracker: How many COVID-19 cases are there in Canada and worldwide? The latest maps and charts
But today, the number of those across Canada who say they will not get the vaccine has dropped, significantly so in Alberta. The pollster said this week that 16 per cent of Albertans say they will not be vaccinated (a probability sample of this size would carry a margin of error of +/- three percentage points, 19 times out of 20). It’s still higher than the national average – again about double the rate of both Ontario and B.C. – but the Alberta numbers are coming closer to those in the rest of the country.
“I can’t express how happy I am that it has dropped, precipitously,” said Cheryl Peters, an epidemiologist at the Cumming School of Medicine at the University of Calgary.
With all the emphasis on vaccine hesitancy, it can be lost that most Albertans are keen on vaccines. More than 51 per cent of Albertan adults and teens have at least one dose, Chief Medical Officer of Health Deena Hinshaw said Thursday. That’s on par with Friday’s national rate of 49 per cent of Canadians having one dose. Alberta also has a high-for-Canadian-provinces rate of second shots or full vaccination, at 8 per cent.
But months ago, there were more people in the province skeptical that COVID-19 was a serious public-health threat – a factor closely related to vaccine hesitancy or resistance – than there are now.
Alberta has only in recent days been able to shake the unhappy status of having the highest infection rate in North America (the province is now second to Manitoba). Certainly some views have been changed by news of near-overwhelmed ICUs and delayed surgeries, or by personal acquaintance with someone who became ill with COVID-19.
Vaccine hesitancy rates across the country have also gone down thanks to the “seeing is believing” trend, as Angus Reid Institute president Shachi Kurl describes it. Watching parents, grandparents and friends get the vaccine is a powerful motivator in both assuaging safety fears about vaccines, and increasing FOMO. “Fear of missing out is a powerful emotion,” Ms. Kurl said.
Albertans have that, and they also have particularly close ties to family and colleagues in the western United States, where vaccines are widely available. And it’s not lost that the U.S. is in a better position now because of near-universal availability of vaccines there.
To be sure, there have been missteps in the vaccine messaging. Premier Jason Kenney has at times been overly solicitous to those who didn’t want to get the vaccine. The fact that some United Conservative Party MLAs, some of whom were also opposed to broad health restrictions, haven’t talked about getting the vaccine – even when specifically asked – is a stand for personal privacy but not a compelling demonstration of leadership.
But the messaging that vaccines are the clear path out of restrictions seems to be getting through. Angus Reid pointed out vaccine uptake has been strong across the country despite deeply conflicting and confusing messages on the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine from federal bodies and political leaders.
And research by The New York Times has found the best way to talk about vaccines with “COVID skeptics” – those who don’t trust that the disease is serious and who believe unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about COVID-19 – is to emphasize that “vaccination is their own, personal choice – one that can help them protect friends and family members.”
To people who can’t wait to get vaccinated, it’s baffling that Mr. Kenney and other politicians have underscored the message of personal choice. But those words aren’t for vaccine cheerleaders, they’re for skeptics.
Governments across Canada will soon have to decide how much effort to focus on the vaccine-hesitant or -resistant. Manitoba, for one, says it will announce a vaccine incentive program next week. The province seems to be taking a page from the U.S. states and cities offering cash and gift cards. Watch for a race to come up with the most creative vaccine gifts to become a thing here, as well.
But the country is now on track to have supplies possibly sufficient to shorten the interval between the two shots. It’s good for public health if more or most Canadians can be fully vaccinated in a much shorter timeline than planned. And it might be advantageous from a messaging point of view, too.
As Ms. Kurl said, fear of being left out is a powerful motivator. Some skeptics changed their minds when they saw or read of vaccine successes in Israel, the U.S. and Britain. I saw more FOMO this month, when Alberta became the first province to announce it was offering the COVID-19 vaccinations to teenagers, too.
If the vaccine-resistant see people getting their second jabs, and confidently eating at restaurants, or going to school and business openings – maybe even some day shedding their masks, or being able to travel – it might change their minds about the first shot.

Testing must be aggressive, including early intervention with communities, and with vulnerable patients, to avert serious symptoms that will stress emergency care, writes Jim Harding.
Finally, we have provincial scenarios. The Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) assumes 15 per cent to 40 per cent of people will get infected. But why is their lowest projection of 3,075 people dying, within our small population, so close to China’s total? And why was their lowest estimate higher than provinces with larger populations?

There is lots of room for public confusion.
By World Health Day (April 7), five per cent of those diagnosed globally had died. It was over 10 per cent for Italy and Spain but only over one per cent for Germany. U.S. was at three per cent, and Canada two per cent, the figure SHA uses.
These seemingly small differences make a huge difference in lives lost or saved. We should know why death rates are so variable; Ontario so far at nearly four per cent, B.C. above three per cent, while Quebec is above one per cent.
SHA modelling is vague, with no prediction for peaking or timeframe for social distancing. SHA claims it can’t be specific because the disease “progression here is behind” other places. Actually, this lag is what enables more effective strategies. This also requires federally co-ordinated leadership.
What is the specific strategy to stop transmission so that feared surges don’t occur? What’s the plan for at-risk Indigenous communities ?
S HA’s “key strategies” are increasing testing to identify cases early and allow contact tracing . We know from abroad that this is vital, but it must be aggressive, including early intervention with communities, and with vulnerable patients, to avert serious symptoms that will stress emergency care.
Our testing rate of 1,000 per 100,000 by April 3, was second highest, after Alberta. B.C. and Quebec were similar, but Ontario was lower (445). We need standardized practices everywhere."

Article content Saskatchewan has the lowest vaccination rate in Canada. This is by design; public policy guarantees low uptake. The government’s rationale is crystal clear: “I think you’re infringing on people’s personal rights if you’re mandating things,” Health Minister Paul Merriman said on Aug. 25.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content Merriman is correct: When public policy requires you to do something that you would not otherwise do, in a formal sense, your rights are infringed. The government has framed the vaccine debate as Big Brother vs. the sanctity of individual autonomy, which takes mandates off the table on principle. The results are avoidable sickness and death, exhausted health-care workers put perpetually at risk and ongoing economic chaos and uncertainty. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.
tap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: Sask. Party gambling that no action on pandemic will equal political glory Back to video So the government has taken a principled stand against mandates. Uh, no. Like all governments, the Saskatchewan Party mandates many things, like passing a driver’s test and a surtax on electric vehicles. If violating individual rights were anathema, my right to drive as fast as I want would trump the government’s imposition of a speed limit. My right to put up a 50-floor condominium wherever I want would trump zoning bylaws. There would be no functioning society without literally thousands of mandates that make all of us do what some of us don’t want to do. No, the government isn’t against mandates; it is against mandates that would offend a substantial portion of its political base. One might disagree with a government that declares individual autonomy as so sacred a principle that it is worth sacrificing the health and life of many people to uphold it. But it is at least a coherent position that takes courage to articulate and apply. What’s critical is transparency: Tell the public why you’re refusing to impose a mandate, and importantly, also publish estimates of how many people will get sick and die if, say, 250,000 people never get vaccinated vs. 50,000.

Article content Is that what Premier Scott Moe and Health Minister Merriman believe? Hell no. They encourage everyone to get vaccinated, because it’s just common sense in the face of the pandemic. Moreover, they have from Day 1 gone on all-in on vaccines as the ultimate and self-sufficient weapon against COVID in the hope that measures requiring some individual sacrifice, like masking in indoor spaces and restrictions on mass gatherings, would be unnecessary. They clearly think it’s wrong-headed to forego the vaccine. But they won’t make anyone get it, because of their unshakable devotion to autonomy. Oh, but it’s fine for others to impose mandates. The Saskatchewan Roughriders will require proof of vaccination to attend Mosaic Stadium, or a recent negative test result. Educational institutions will require vaccination for students to attend in person. Businesses can insist on proof of vaccination to enter their spaces. When asked, Moe and Merriman are fine with all of it. I suspect they’re delighted. Oh but the government is cagey! Let retailers and restaurateurs take the heat from irate refuseniks rather than take it themselves. Let the opposition hang itself by calling for measures the government knows will prevent illness and death, but refuses to implement to keep the faithful happy. It can free ride on the goodwill and rationality of the majority while cementing its stranglehold on its base and starving the nascent Buffalo Party of political oxygen.

It’s a cynical strategy from a government with a seemingly ironclad grip on over 60 per cent of the electorate. It’s what the province has signed up for. Saskatchewan is, for the foreseeable future, a one-party state. The province has botched the pandemic from the beginning, always reacting too late and doing too little, and it has abandoned all reasonable hope of attaining a vaccination rate anywhere close to achieving herd immunity. Yet Moe and his party remain immensely popular, while his Ontario and Alberta soulmates got hammered for similar missteps.

Article content On March 15, our province hit the one-year anniversary since we first locked down to get control of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reasoning for this shutdown was simple. With very little knowledge on how the virus spread, and seeing catastrophic outbreaks in China and Italy, the government asked everyone to stay at home until public health experts had a chance to gain an understanding of the virus.

When the entire world went into lockdown, Canada’s major airlines worked with the federal government and our airports to bring home thousands of Canadians stranded abroad. They helped to ship millions of dollars worth of necessary medical supplies and personal protective equipment.

Article content As most governments re-opened most businesses over the course of summer 2020, we learned more about the virus, including where it transmitted most quickly. We learned quite early on that airline travel, previously seen as a major vector of transmission, was actually quite safe as innovations in air filtration reduced the spread within planes. Minister Marc Garneau and Chief Medical Officer of Health Theresa Tam stated that they found no evidence of any transmission happening on board aircraft. International health agencies such as America’s Centre for Disease Control and the World Health Organization verified that these were low-risk activities. Yet when the world plunged into a second wave, many of the lessons we learned over the first six months of the pandemic were forgotten. Some jurisdictions brought in nonsensical business policies allowing big-box stores to remain open while shutting down the smaller businesses that sold many of the same things. Others tried to parse what kind of goods were considered essential and should be allowed to be sold.

Article content Other groups chose to assign blame. Much of this blame was placed at the feet of Canadian airlines and travellers, despite a lack of evidence that airlines were contributing significantly to spread. An industry that employed 154,000 across Canada. At this point, airlines have spent over a year operating at a loss while taking extraordinary steps to protect customers with a federal government that has offered no support. They have taken real actions to harm the industry, ranging from draconian “quarantine hotels” to shutting down of provincial programs aimed to keep travel safe without being impossible. Neither of these decisions were evidence-based. What we need now is an evidence-based policy from governments that allows for some form of domestic and international travel to be done responsibly. This has been done largely around the world and it is time for Canada to catch up.

Article content Canada currently has restrictions for flying within our country. Similar restrictions exist nowhere else in the world. Canada also hasn’t moved towards testing and limited quarantines for international travel while policies similar to that are being adopted throughout the world. Major companies and employers are at risk. A year ago, WestJet employed 14,000 people. Today, it’s about 5,600. Tourism generally makes up 10 per cent of Canadian jobs, and the industry took almost twice the hit faced by other industries. As Albertans we may take for granted the privilege that comes with having a global airline based out of our province. We are now a year into the pandemic. The vaccination effort is well underway. Global COVID cases are falling quickly, and we understand a lot more about COVID-19. Vaccines are getting to Canada, in large part thanks to our aviation sector. We know that airline travel can be safe, even outside our borders. It is being done internationally, and the international pilot program run through Calgary International Airport proved that it can be done here. The aviation sector doesn’t need a bailout. What they need is for governments to create policy that allows for safe air travel domestically and abroad with rigorous testing and precautions to keep it safe. It is now time for governments to give the aviation sector that certainty. John Liston is president of Alberta Enterprise Group.

Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: Alberta restaurants need long-term help recovering from COVID-19 Back to video Not only was the restaurant industry among the first and hardest hit by the pandemic, the sector will be among the slowest to return to profitability: Six of 10 Canadian food-service businesses are still operating at a loss, even as jurisdictions across the country are moving forward with reopening plans. With the average restaurant typically needing about a third of its operating budget just to cover labour costs, restaurateurs understandably breathed a sigh of relief on May 15, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that the federal government would be extending the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) program to Aug. 29.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content A month since the announcement, however, it’s become clear that it’s going to take more than a simple extension of this program to help restaurants bring more Albertans back to work. When initially introduced, the CEWS program was to run for 12 weeks, retroactive to March 15, limiting employers to only being able to benefit from the subsidy until June 6. The extension announcement gave hope to many restaurant operators who were not yet ready to reopen that this assistance might still be available once they’re able to use it. The announcement was also welcomed by establishments that have remained open since emergency restrictions were first imposed, as most restaurants that have continued to operate take-out and delivery services have done so at a loss.

Article content But after months of significantly reduced revenue, or none at all, and now facing months of operating at reduced capacity, this is only the beginning of what will be a long and difficult road to recovery for Alberta’s restaurants. Given this reality, they need continued government support for the long term, not just until an arbitrary end date. The wage subsidy should continue to be available to businesses as needed, to keep them from falling off cliffs when the assistance they’re receiving with payroll suddenly drops from 75 per cent to zero. Instead, a smooth ramp of support that reduces as a restaurant gets closer to manageable levels of revenue variance would be the best way to extend the program. The requirement to demonstrate a 30-per-cent decline in revenue should also be scaled to remove any concern that increasing sales could result in losing access to the subsidy. This would help restaurants hang onto their staff while they’re still working on generating enough revenue to no longer need government support. The wage subsidy has already helped Alberta’s restaurant industry recover more than 7,000 jobs initially lost during the pandemic. But at least 70,000 people previously employed in the food-service sector were still out of work across the province in May. Reforming the wage subsidy will give restaurants greater capacity to bring more of these Albertans back to work.

British Columbia looks to create its own pandemic bubble,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-british-columbia-looks-to-create-its-own-pandemic-bubble/,www.theglobeandmail.com,Province seeks legal opinion on whether it can limit visitors from the rest of Canada,['Justine Hunter'],2021-01-14 21:42:08,"Businesses have started putting up signs welcoming traveling Albertans back to the small town of Radium Hot Springs, B.C., June 29, 2020.TODD KOROL/The Globe and Mail
The B.C. government is reviewing legal advice on whether it can restrict non-essential travel across provincial boundaries as frustrations mount about non-resident visitors who ignore requests to stay home to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Premier John Horgan said his cabinet is considering the legal opinion it has received and he expects to make an announcement early next week. B.C. would be the largest province to impose restrictions on interprovincial travellers, an extraordinary step in the fight to contain the pandemic.
The Atlantic provinces have maintained restrictions for non-residents for months, requiring all non-essential visitors to quarantine for two weeks. Pandemic travel restrictions imposed by the Newfoundland and Labrador government also survived a Charter challenge.
Since November, as the second wave of the pandemic accelerated, the Provincial Health Officer has advised B.C. residents not to travel for vacations or to visit friends or family outside of their household or core bubble. The Premier said he is responding to public concern “about people coming from elsewhere when they’re making sacrifices of their own,” he said.
Since the arrival of the pandemic early in 2020, Mr. Horgan has said Canadians have Charter-protected mobility rights within the country, and closing the province to other Canadians was initially dismissed as impractical, in part because of the large number of Albertans who own recreational property in B.C.
B.C. has not spelled out whether it would prefer restrictions on who can enter, quarantine requirements, or other measures.
Mr. Horgan told reporters on Thursday that public anger has been stoked by politicians and other public figures who travelled out of the country over Christmas. While no members of B.C.’s legislative assembly left the province over the holidays, he said, the stories “led to a firestorm of frustration and anger, because Canadians and British Columbians are making sacrifices, and one of those sacrifices is staying close to home, not travelling to see loved ones, not going to tend to what would have been traditions, or pressing matters; the loss of life of a loved one in another part of the country.”
The Premier expressed frustration that directions from provincial and territorial leaders to discourage non-essential travel around the country have been ineffective. “It would seem an easy thing to do to just tell people not to come here,” he said.
B.C. has been a destination for Canadian travellers this winter, including thousands of so-called snowbirds who were discouraged from going to the United States for the winter because of international travel restrictions.
The Canadian Camping and RV Council has helped secure about 5,000 RV camping locations for Canadians on Vancouver Island and around the lower mainland.
The organization’s executive director, Shane Devenish, said in an interview that his organization would oppose any attempt to curb cross-country travel. “Officially, we would be against that. I understand what they are trying to do, but the freedom for RVers to go from one province to another is important,” Mr. Devenish said. “We will follow that closely, British Columbia being such a popular destination.”
Canada’s four Atlantic provinces have had barriers to non-essential travel from other parts of the country since the pandemic began. Those restrictions, requiring two weeks of self-isolation upon entrance, have helped the region keep case numbers among the lowest in the developed world – but have also come at great cost to industries connected to travel.
Until November, residents of Atlantic Canada could travel freely among the four provinces without needing to quarantine. That agreement, called the Atlantic Bubble, ended when cases in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick began to rise.
Cara Zwibel, a lawyer for the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, said B.C. will have to tread carefully, and suggested that it should seek the least restrictive measures to achieve its objectives.
“It’s certainly been the recommendations throughout much of this [pandemic] that people shouldn’t be travelling around for non-essential reasons,” she said. “I understand the reasoning behind it, and the desire of governments to try to curb that one potential source of new infections and transmission. But I do believe that the Charter protects the rights of Canadians to move freely within the country.”
The association launched a Charter challenge last year to Newfoundland and Labrador’s travel restrictions on behalf of Nova Scotian Kimberley Taylor, who was denied entry to attend her mother’s funeral.
The provincial Supreme Court upheld the travel restriction, confirming that Ms. Taylor’s Charter right to mobility within Canada was infringed, but it ruled that infringement was justified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The civil liberties group intends to appeal.
Constitutional expert Errol Mendes, a law professor at the University of Ottawa, said B.C. can expect a Charter challenge if it attempts to impose travel restrictions on Canadians outside its boundaries, but it could defend limits if it can demonstrate that those infringements are reasonable to protect public health.
“The onus will be on the government to show compelling evidence,” he said. The Newfoundland and Labrador government presented modelling to show the court that COVID-19 would spread faster without travel restrictions, and that the biggest risk to the province was the introduction of the disease from other jurisdictions. It also argued that its limited health care resources – just 92 intensive care unit beds – means that a surge in cases would put the health care system in jeopardy. Prof. Mendes said British Columbia would have to provide its own scientific and health data to establish a similar risk.

Article content COVID-19 has created an unprecedented challenge for policy-makers. Their decisions will have a direct and sustained impact on our physical, mental, social and economic well-being . Policy-makers must be guided above all by evidence, because as they say, “Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not to their own facts.” Our review of World Health Organization guidance suggests it’s time for governments to revisit the drastic measures of closing all parks and recreation amenities.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content In the early days of the COVID-19 crisis, valid evidence was at a premium. As the potential scale of the pandemic emerged, most jurisdictions chose speed over precision. In military terms, because of a lack of intelligence on how and where to target, governments decided on a broad carpet-bombing containment strategy, rather than targeted surgical strikes. The result was governments in Canada and across the world put broad restrictions on citizens’ movements to slow the spread of COVID-19 and minimize stress on health-care systems. This was prudent and the past four weeks of data suggest it is working. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: It's time to carefully reopen parks and recreation areas Back to video However, after almost a month, like other countries, it’s time to revisit those decisions based on nuanced and contextual evidence. It’s time to use the benefit of this evidence to be far more precise. In fact, the WHO is so concerned about the spread of COVID-19 misinformation that it introduced a Myth busters website to battle the real threat of what it is deeming an “infodemic.” This infodemic is not spreading based on facts, it’s spreading based on fear. As Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister (taoiseach) and a medical doctor, declared: “We need to halt the spread of the virus, but we also need to halt the spread of fear, fear is a virus in itself.”

Article content One specific policy area we believe it is essential to refine is the blanket closure of parks, recreational and public spaces, and proposals to expand and extend these closures. While the WHO remains vigilant and focused on restricting the spread of COVID-19, it has also raised concerns about the longer-term impact of mass quarantines on mental and physical wellness. The WHO and many other public health experts do not believe that constraining the spread of COVID-19 and maintaining physical and mental well-being are mutually exclusive. In fact, the WHO introduced guidelines to promote physical activity, including guidelines on walking, running, cycling and use of parks and other public spaces. Similarly, the physical distancing guidance provided by public health experts at a provincial and national level are consistent: maintaining physical activity, while also physical distancing, is a critical component of a holistic COVID-19 prevention strategy.

Article content Therefore, we are perplexed that many governments in our country, contradicting the nuanced guidance of public health professionals around physical distancing and safe physical activity, continue to formally or informally restrict safe physical activities. As we shift into spring and summer, these contradictory positions must be aligned to introduce holistic COVID-19 prevention policies that not only enable but promote physical activities that align with the most current physical distancing guidelines. As we’ve seen on the crowded pathways in the past few days, without a sustainable holistic plan, the mass closing of parks and recreation amenities is concentrating Calgarians into a smaller number of spaces and negatively impacting both physical distancing and physical activity.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content As a start, we propose four actionable recommendations for leaders at all levels to adopt: Prioritize physical and mental well-being: As part of a holistic COVID-19 community prevention strategy, all communities should establish a task force on physical and mental well-being. This task force should adopt an evidence-based decision framework focused on the question: How can we safely use parks and recreation amenities to promote physical activity that aligns with current physical distancing guidelines? This challenges the pervasive position adopted during the first month, which is best described as “Keep it simple and close everything regardless of the level of risk.” This should include contextualizing evidence from other jurisdictions such as Austria and the Czech Republic and which are testing innovative adaptations of sport and recreation activities that maintain physical distancing while promoting health and wellness. Prioritize funding to safely reopen amenities: As part of this holistic strategy, governments must prioritize funding to support the safe reopening of local, provincial and national parks and recreation amenities in a manner that aligns with both physical distancing and physical activity guidelines. For example, this could include the creative use of the Canada Summer Jobs grants to hire students as physical distancing ambassadors in parks, trails, pathways, golf courses, tennis courts, basketball courts, waterways and playgrounds. Sensible adaptations might include closing clubhouses and showers, mandating that tennis courts only be open for singles matches and basketball courts only for shooting hoops, not games. Introduce a zero-tolerance policy: Governments should introduce a zero-tolerance policy for those who violate the safe use of our parks and recreation amenities and threaten the health and wellness of the broad community. Penalties should range from significant fines to banning future access to all public recreation amenities. Promote the importance of safe physical activity: Maintaining both physical activity and physical distancing is critical to the sustained social, physical, and mental well-being of citizens and communities. Governments must challenge the misinformation, fear and public shaming entrenched on social media that suggests that all community-based physical activity is a threat to public safety. As part of this, governments must guide citizens to timely, evidence-based health and wellness information, including the use of parks and recreation amenities. Evidence must trump fear. An essential step in our country’s COVID-19 recovery strategy is for leaders to adopt evidence-based policies that promote the physical and mental well-being of all Canadians, Albertans and Calgarians. It’s time to get some exercise. Be safe. David J.

Article content I was a junior high school student at Swift Current’s O.M. Irwin School in the late 1970s when the province of Saskatchewan introduced its seatbelt law . Saskatchewan was the third province to mandate seatbelts, and the 1977 law required drivers, front-seat passengers and children under 16 to buckle up.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content The seatbelt law aroused a good deal of controversy across the province, which I remember well, in part because the Irwin School debate club decided to take up the topic. The question posed was something like, “Should the Saskatchewan government require the use of seatbelts?” The Yes side went first and presented a LOT of data — studies, statistics, charts, and so forth — proving beyond a doubt, it seemed to me, that seatbelts reduced injuries and saved lives. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.
tap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: Will we look back on vaccine mandates as we do on mandatory seatbelts? Back to video By the time the Yes side finished its opening argument, I felt sorry for the No side that was about to present their case. “Poor students,” I thought. “They don’t stand a chance. It’s not even a fair debate question.” When the No side began, its speakers immediately agreed with everything the Yes side had presented! Seatbelts surely reduced injuries and saved lives, they concurred. But that was not the debate question. The question, they explained, was whether the Saskatchewan government should mandate their use. Simply put, should seatbelts be required by law?
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content My memory of that moment is that the air left the room. Suddenly, everything the Yes side had just presented about how well seatbelts worked seemed, well, beside the point. For me, at least, it was a remarkable moment, and one I still remember vividly — no doubt with the embellishment of nostalgia. The balance of the No case in that junior-high seatbelt debate focused, as you might well imagine, on the limits of governmental authority and the importance of individual rights and freedoms. Outside the classroom, and despite the irritation of a good many Saskatchewan drivers, the seatbelt law stood. In those days, tickets were $20. Over time, province after province enacted similar mandates. Alberta was the last to do so, a full decade behind Saskatchewan. Gradually, seatbelt laws evolved . In time, everyone had to wear a seatbelt, and requirements were added for special car seats for infants and booster seats for young children. And the fines went up too.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content Unsurprisingly, injuries and deaths from car accidents decreased over time, as seatbelt use increased. But compliance was spotty in the early 1980s. As a teenager, I remember unbuckling so I could lie down in the back seat on road trips with my parents. Even as an adult, I would often neglect to buckle up for short trips around town, when I was on my own in the car. These days, that’s almost impossible. My car nags me until I engage my seatbelt. My semi-conscious and token resistance — the residue of growing up in the 1970s — is to put my car in drive and buckle up as the car starts to roll forward. But some Canadians resisted seatbelt laws more forcefully. In 1987, Kim Maier, “a bit of a maverick,” challenged Alberta’s brand-new seatbelt law by “circling the Calgary police station with his seat belt hanging out the door.” Then, “he put a sign on his truck announcing his misdeed to the world.” Finally, “he took to shouting at passing police cruisers: ‘Hey, I’m not wearing a seat belt. Give me a ticket.’” On July 5, 1987, after taunting Calgary police for eight hours , Maier got the ticket he craved.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content In court, Maier quickly confessed that he was guilty of the law as written, but that was not the point. What he wanted was to challenge the law itself, arguing that the seatbelt mandate was an infringement of “his right to ‘life, liberty, and security of the person’ as guaranteed by Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.” Like others — you’ll remember this if you’re old enough — he argued that seatbelts were dangerous, because they could trap drivers in their vehicles, make them slide under the dash in the event of an accident, or pose a danger to pedestrians and cyclists because drivers wearing seatbelts would feel overconfident and drive recklessly at faster speeds. Maier called various witnesses who testified along these lines. One even tried to prove that seatbelts didn’t actually reduce injuries or save lives.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content Given our long-running experience of seatbelt use, you will not be surprised to learn that the court ruled that “the principle of fundamental justice” had not been violated. Moreover, the judge determined that the benefits of seatbelts justified the mandating of their use as “a reasonable limit (to freedom) demonstrably justified in a free and democratic country.” Maier appealed and the seatbelt law was temporarily called into question until the Alberta Court of Appeal once more confirmed the original judgment. Maier remained steadfast in his anti-seatbelt convictions. His rationale? “I like risk and I think seatbelts reduce my enjoyment of life. I’m doing this so that my kids can enjoy life.” He tried to appeal his case to the Supreme Court of Canada, but the court refused to consider the case .

Article content Today, we’re engaged in a similar debate about COVID-19 vaccines, which are the product of an unprecedented emergency global research collaboration. Their development and approval have been marked by abundant funding, extensive testing, and a top-priority-no-red-tape path through a normally bureaucratic regulatory process. While some still argue that vaccines are ineffective, unsafe or worse, other Canadians express concern over the role of the government in requiring vaccines through a vaccine mandate (in Alberta, the “ Restrictions Exemption Program ”) and a vaccine passport (in Alberta, the “ card-sized vaccination record ”). I have no doubt there will be court challenges to vaccine mandates across Canada, based on constitutional grounds. I expect they will fail, in much the same way as Kim Maier’s seatbelt case failed in the 1980s and 1990s.

Article content What is both more important and more hopeful, I would argue, is the way in which the government legislation of seatbelt use changed our views — our culture — over time. Few today would argue that seatbelt laws are controversial. More than that, our attitudes have evolved. Today, most of us would gasp if we saw a family driving down the freeway with a parent sitting in the front seat holding an infant on their lap — neither with any restraint holding them in — even though many of us grew up that way. And while historians like me generally avoid predictions about the future — we know that life rarely unfolds quite the way we expect it to — we do seek to learn lessons from the past that will help us in our present lives. Considering the history of seatbelt legislation, then, I think it’s reasonably likely that, a decade or two from now, we will look back in wonderment over both the vaccine hesitancy of some Canadians and the angry protests of a smaller anti-vaccination faction. And tragically, as with seatbelts, some among us will carry the lifelong pain of family members lost to needless death.

Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: Ban on abortion protesters outside clinics would protect patients and staff Back to video The Saskatchewan law would ban anti-abortion protesters within 50 metres of a facility, and in some cases 150 metres. British Columbia has enforced a very similar law since 1995 and it has been held to be constitutional. Therefore, we can be confident that Bill 608 would also meet Charter scrutiny. In fact, based on the legal soundness of the B.C. law, similar laws have been passed in five provinces: Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and Nova Scotia. Saskatchewan would simply be following in their footsteps. While safe access zone laws do infringe on free speech, it’s not a blanket restriction. Protesters are free to protest anywhere except within a narrow zone around facilities that provide abortion. A key part of our Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Section 1, allows fundamental rights like freedom of expression to be limited in a reasonable manner to protect other rights. Protesters also should not be allowed to force their message onto a captive audience — in this case people accessing a medically necessary service that’s available at only handful of locations in Saskatchewan.

Article content The B.C. Court of Appeal ruled in 2008 (R. v. Spratt, 2008 BCCA 340) that the Access to Abortion Services Act is constitutional because women’s right to access a necessary medical treatment in an atmosphere of privacy, safety and dignity takes precedence over freedom of expression in that specific context. When the protesters appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, it declined to take the case, meaning the law stands as constitutional. The B.C. law has successfully deterred protesters and protected people at clinics for 26 years. After the law passed in 1995, protesters stopped coming to one clinic, while at another clinic, protesters had to stand across the street and could no longer approach or identify patients entering the clinic. Clinics in B.C. and across the country have reported that their safe access zone laws work well. Although a legal challenge is currently happening in Ontario, launched by an Ottawa protester, we are confident the government will prevail based on evidence and past precedent. Safe access zones are important because they ensure the safety and privacy of providers, staff and patients as they come and go from the facility. The zones protect the right to access health-care services and safeguard patients’ health by reducing the risk of complications from emotional distress (caused by the protesters) just before undergoing a medical procedure. Further, the zones foster community peace by reducing neighbourhood nuisance and noise and other hazards, and limiting the risk of violence and vandalism.

Article content Some opposed to safe access zones claim that existing laws against assault and harassment should be used instead. This won’t work because it requires people to press charges and testify in court. Women going to a clinic for a procedure as private and stigmatized as abortion virtually never pursue criminal charges. Second, it’s not just criminal activities that pose a problem — the mere presence of “peaceful” protesters causes anxiety and fear for patients and gives rise to confidentiality concerns. Given the intrusive nature of anti-choice protests outside facilities that provide abortion, people deserve the ongoing protection and privacy that only a safe-access zone law can provide. We urge all Saskatchewan MLAs to vote in favour of this important bill to protect the safety, dignity and privacy of patients who need an abortion.

Opinion: How to mark a unique Remembrance Day,https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/opinion-how-to-mark-a-unique-remembrance-day,montrealgazette.com,"If 19-year-old kids could face death storming a beach in 1944, you can find a way to pay your respects in spite of COVID-19.",['Michael Major'],2020-11-11 00:00:00,"We may not be able to gather as usual to reflect and remember as a community this Remembrance Day, but it is still important that we honour our fallen and our veterans in different and unique ways.
For those who make it a point to be at a cenotaph every Nov. 11, I will remind you that cenotaphs are in place 24/7. You are free to visit and pay your respects anytime. Without the crowds, the hallowed ground of your local cenotaph takes on a far more solemn atmosphere. I swear I can feel the energy of everyone who wore the uniform before me radiating through the stone and epitaphs of that sacred space.
This leads me into a project that you and your family can engage in this Remembrance Day. The records of First World War soldiers are available online, free of charge. I urge you to look up a name or two. I often sit and read through the records of a random soldier or nursing sister. These documents humanize the names that we see on the cenotaphs and, in turn, we start to get a picture of who they were. (Spoiler alert: They are not much different from you or me.)
Something I like to do in the lead-up to Nov. 11 is to level up my knowledge of military history. I especially like to try to find accounts from the troops on the front lines or to learn about some of the more obscure and lesser known battles or actions. Canada has a rich military history that touches pretty much every major conflict in some way, not to mention the many peacekeeping missions that Canada has been involved in. Go down a Wikipedia rabbit hole, watch a documentary, check out a history book from the library, or research your own family’s history. There are countless resources available to assist you both online and offline.
Yes, we are not going to be able to gather this Remembrance Day the way we normally would, but that is not an excuse to forgo reflecting and remembering. Nov. 11, 2000, saw me sitting in the back of a Grizzly armoured vehicle providing security for the Bosnian elections. We still took two minutes of silence on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month to reflect on our brethren who made the ultimate sacrifice.
If 19-year-old kids could face death storming a beach in 1944, you can take two minutes out of your day to remember them, and find a way to pay your respects in spite of COVID-19. At the least, take to social media to show that you are wearing a poppy, learning about Canada’s involvement in conflicts or visiting the graves of soldiers. Our soldiers did not let evil win, and you certainly should not let COVID-19 win by breaking faith with those who died.
Lest we forget.
Under the red-zone restrictions covering much of Quebec, Remembrance Day commemorations are being significantly pared down this year. In Montreal, the ceremony at Place du Canada is closed to spectators. The national ceremony in Ottawa can be viewed on television or via Facebook.
To access personnel records of First World War soldiers, search for “Library and Archives of Canada” in your web browser. There you will find a search function at the top right. Input: “Soldiers of the First World War”.

Article content With the worsening ongoing pandemic, public health protocols have called for exceptional measures in Alberta and elsewhere in Canada, including restricting movement and prohibiting assembling. This includes constraints on gatherings in places of worship and, indeed, even in our own homes.

Article content Politicians and others argue for enforcing stronger measures, stating that the government has an obligation to protect Canadians: it can and therefore it should. However, the government has not pursued further public health measures because it could also impair the Charter rights and freedoms of individual Canadians. This middle ground can be confusing. It is hard to discern the government’s real ability to uphold our fundamental rights and freedoms. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: COVID is a wakeup call that rights and freedoms can be tested in a crisis Back to video Can the Canadian government place limits on our Charter rights? The short answer is — yes. All three levels of Canadian government can use Section 1 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms to impose reasonable limits on Canadians’ rights and freedoms. This is what gives the government the legal authority to mandate mask-wearing, which has become a lightning rod in the U.S. and for some in Canada. However, Michelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for human rights, has warned countries against using COVID-19 as an “excuse for human rights violations.”

Article content This pandemic highlights three key issues affecting Canadians’ Charter rights: Access to health care and employment COVID-19 disproportionately affects poor, racialized minorities, especially, women, living in Canadian cities, thus revealing how the pandemic exacerbates many longstanding social and economic inequalities. Both Statistics Canada and Public Health Ontario confirm that these groups experience more discriminatory and adverse effects of COVID-19. They face more risk because they often work frontline jobs, live in smaller and more crowded homes, and encounter barriers when accessing health information. Another StatsCan study says that their existing high poverty rates make them more vulnerable to the financial impact of work disruptions.

Article content Despite the absence of an explicit reference to socio-economic rights in the Charter, the right to equality (Section 15) and the right to “life, liberty and security of the person” (Section 7) and provincial human rights legislation together protect these people from any form of discrimination in health care and employment. But, public- and private-sector organizations must recognize their human rights obligations and consider the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on the vulnerable groups they employ or provide services. Availability of affordable housing COVID is rendering many Canadians homeless, as more people cannot pay their rent or access homeless shelters due to the spread of the virus within the shelter system. In Edmonton and Calgary, about 2,000-3,000 people are homeless — a figure that has risen dramatically since the pandemic began. Several hundred people now sleep outside every night in frigid weather.

Article content The end of provincial eviction bans, as of September, only makes this worse. And many provinces have also lifted the rent increase freeze. Tent cities keep emerging across Canadian cities, even though many municipalities have tried to help. Obviously, the cumulative effect of these changes will hit low-income renters hard in coming months. Unfortunately, housing is not a Charter-protected right in Canada. The federal government’s new housing strategy is based on human rights, but it is not a constitutionally guaranteed right. However, it should be one. It is poor, racialized, or Indigenous people, people with disabilities, and others who are protected under Charter Section 15 or provincial human rights legislation who need or currently occupy affordable housing. Although not stated explicitly, the Alberta Human Rights Act and the Ontario Human Rights Code appear to suggest that they prohibit discrimination based on poverty, through key phrases like “source of income” or “receipt of public assistance.” But, still, the poor remain unprotected and often unhoused.

Article content Restrictions on religious services COVID-19 has instigated constraints on gatherings at places of worship. These measures have affected two Charter freedoms — freedom to assembly and to practise religion. Although not as widespread as lawsuits contesting this in the U.S., a few B.C. church gatherings have defied provincial health directives. When fined, they questioned the validity of the law by citing their rights in Charter Section 2. The pandemic has certainly placed the Canadian government in a serious bind: how to maintain its obligation to keep Canadians safe while upholding its human rights obligations. It has added to our societal vulnerablities given that many Canadians are in precarious employment or housing situations, The pandemic has worsened the situation of many ethno-racial communities, many of which were already living on the verge of crisis.

Article content In a way, this pandemic is a wake-up call that our fundamental rights and freedoms can be so easily tested under trying circumstances. Without a deliberate and long-term commitment to human rights, any future adversities will further aggravate existing inequities and vulnerabilities in our society. At present, the government must prioritize Charter-protected groups in its COVID-19 vaccine rollout plan, putting them at the front of the line to be vaccinated: older people living alone or in institutions, Indigenous peoples, precarious workers, people experiencing poverty and homelessness, and people with disabilities.

OPINION: Northwestern Ontario bubble could curb COVID-19 spread
Article content Would a northwestern Ontario bubble prevent the rising number of COVID-19 infections in Toronto and Manitoba to arrive in our plot of the Canadian Shield? It sounds crazy, but we’re not that far away.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content I was scrolling through social media the other day and saw an interesting idea from Red Lake physician Dr. Lisa Habermehl, which was to create a northwestern Ontario bubble, much like the Atlantic provinces did at the onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. OPINION: Northwestern Ontario bubble could curb COVID-19 spread Back to video The bubble essentially requires anyone travelling from out of province to self-isolate for 14 days. There are exceptions of course, but the Atlantic provinces have been doing well in terms of case numbers, and so has the northwest. Yes, those nine cases in one day were certainly scary and was a reminder that we are not immune out here. Astonishingly, we have not seen any more positives come out of that situation yet. The Northwestern Health Unit feared there could be community transmission of the virus in Kenora, but so far, so good. I will knock on wood for all of us, however. With clowns to the left of us (Manitoba) and jokers to the right (Greater Toronto Area) we truly are stuck in the middle being in the northwest. A viable solution could be to limit interprovincial and even intra-provincial travel to prevent people from coming in and bringing the virus to our small towns. People could still come to the region but would have to isolate upon arrival in this bubble concept. There would be a lot that would go into having that kind of bubble, and it has its flaws, effectively cutting us off from the rest of the country. Many people have family in Winnipeg and southern Ontario, but the health unit is already telling us to avoid nonessential travel out of northern Ontario, which is a wise thing to be doing given the skyrocketing cases in Toronto and Winnipeg.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content I am not advocating for a border shutdown between Manitoba and Ontario, that would be asinine. I recognize that the Trans-Canada Highway exists and the northwest is a vital link to the rest of the country; I also know that many Winnipeg companies conduct business in the region. This bubble idea doesn’t have to be permanent, but until things settle down in the surrounding areas, it may be prudent to do it. Perhaps the health unit could mandate people coming from out of the province to self-isolate for 14 days upon their arrival. They are advising people to self-monitor for 14 days and to isolate if symptoms develop when travelling out of province. They also advise people to self-isolate if they come in contact with a case or known outbreak, which should be fairly obvious at this point. People should already just stay home and avoid nonessential travel, no matter where they are in the country anyway. Atlantic Canada has geography on its side, making a bubble concept easier but it could be done in the northwest. Premier Doug Ford and his chief medical officer Dr. David Williams have been raked over the coals for their response to the rising cases and mixed messaging lately. Ford did praise the north for how well we are doing amidst the pandemic, which is nice but I would like to see him help us out by telling the south to avoid heading up here. Cases may still creep up into Kenora and the surrounding area, but we have done well so far. We got lulled into a false sense of security over the summer, but now is not the time to give up just because “you’re sick of it.” Newsflash: we’re all sick of this stupid virus, but it’s our new reality and we have to live with it.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content Let’s remain vigilant and not be dumb about this, things could go south here fast if we start to think we’re invincible. Winnipeg is a good example, they moved into a fourth phase of reopening in July and their cases have not stopped climbing since. We’ve been fortunate that since moving into the third phase of reopening we have not seen that type of spike. People say there has to be a balance between living with the virus and imposing restrictions, and I’m here to tell you that I do not have those answers. Clearly, restrictions worked. Take the situation in western Manitoba — cases were getting out of hand so the province imposed restrictions and two weeks later, cases started going down and they were allowed to have somewhat normal life come back. If that’s the strategy moving forward, I can deal with that. For now, remember to practice good hand hygiene, don’t touch your face in public and wear your damn mask properly. I, along with all of you, am dreaming of the day I never have to hear the term “physical distancing” again. We’ll get through it.

Article content How times change. A year ago, we had no COVID-19 vaccinations, Halloween was cancelled in many parts of the country, and we were entering a winter of fear. This October we should take stock of how far we have come heading into Halloween 2021: We apologize, but this video has failed to load.
tap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: Five reasons why COVID shouldn’t spook us this Halloween Back to video 1. Outdoor activities are OK From the beginning, even before vaccination, it has been obvious that interactions outdoors are very unlikely to transmit COVID . We almost never identify super-spreader events that have resulted from an outdoor event or gathering. This winter, go out and enjoy skiing, snowshoeing or a nice walk in the park — for your mental and physical health. 2. Population immunity has defanged the virus Vaccines reduce severe outcomes by 96 per cent and Canada has vaccinated almost 90 per cent of those who are eligible; 91 per cent of Canadians over 70 are fully vaccinated. If you are somebody with a normal immune system , and you are either vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19, your chances of getting sick enough to need the hospital are very, very small — no higher than other common respiratory virus such as the flu. The notable exception is those who have weakened immune systems. Providing more vaccine doses and using novel therapies may help those people fight off disease. If you are at risk and don’t have immunity, there is still the opportunity to protect yourself by getting vaccinated. Even a single shot reduces your risk of getting very sick; two are even better.

Article content 3. The Delta variant shouldn’t spook us any longer Delta is now causing most COVID-19 infections in Canada. Some people were concerned that the Delta variant would be more deadly, but it hasn’t proven to be so since hospitalizations and deaths are lower and dropping in most places. Even in low-risk populations that aren’t yet vaccinated, such as younger children, Delta variant is proving to be no more likely to result in hospitalization or death than previous variants. 4. For most kids, COVID-19 is the sniffles Parents worry about their children, but the preponderance of data provides reassurance . In Canada we have had almost 350 000 cases of COVID-19 cases in people under the age of 20 with only 0.5 per cent needing hospitalization. Of those, almost two-thirds were admitted for reasons other than COVID. In short, 99.9 per cent of kids who contract COVID-19 are fine. Even before vaccines were available, the risk of death by accident was seven times higher than from COVID (based on a mean from Statistics Canada of 128 accidental deaths per annum for one to 14 year olds). Data from schools around the world have also proven that transmission is rare in schools and even in areas of high community spread, Delta variant or not, the risk of hospitalization is low and deaths are very rare for children and teachers alike. Likewise, we need not fear “long COVID.” Multiple well-performed studies put the risk of prolonged symptoms after COVID infection in children at between zero and one per cent, with resolution to normal within 12 weeks.

Article content 5. Much of the world is giving up restrictions, and we will have to follow While some places such as Saskatchewan, B.C. and Alberta have seen recent surges, we are seeing that places that were hardest hit at the beginning of the pandemic, like Ontario and Quebec, have been having much smaller fourth waves. There are many factors that may explain why some places are doing well and others aren’t, including previous population exposure and vaccination rates. Places like the U.K., Denmark, Norway and many U.S. states have lifted restrictions, and disease rates have dropped or stabilized, not increased. Likewise, deaths have remained low in most places, especially those with high levels of immunity. COVID-19 is becoming a part of life where caution is needed by a few, but the rest of us need to move on. We need to learn from these experiences as we move to an endemic (“we need to live with it”) mindset. We do the same when we drive, play sports, or cross the street. This is especially true for children who need to catch up after 18 months of severe restrictions. This Halloween cherish the little goblins, fairies and witches; their costumes may be scary, but we shouldn’t be afraid.

Andrea McDowell says we need vaccine passports.,[],2021-08-16 00:00:00,"Planners won’t get us out of this mess
More expansionary planning leads to more inefficient communities. As we know planners have created the most inefficient communities in human history over the last 60 years. Planners are not likely to get us out of this trend.
People are now recognizing this reality and are speaking up. This is a message to our leaders to please consider other models for developing and creating sustainable communities. Of course this would include overhauling the current planning organization and bringing in people who understand how to create sustainable communities. It cannot be based solely upon an artificial human creation called the economy and otherwise known as economic development.
The people that can create this change for the most part do not come out of modern professional planning schools. It will be organic in nature and require a deep understanding and experience of the urban landscape.
Walter Furlan, Hamilton
Expansion cannot boost emissions
I am writing to raise my concerns about the framework being used to decide if Hamilton’s urban boundaries should be expanded.
Hamilton Councillors unanimously declared a climate emergency in March of 2019. To the best of my knowledge, this climate emergency has not lessened in the intervening years. In fact, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate urges immediate action to reduce greenhouse emissions to avoid climate disaster.
Given this, I fail to see how any rational decision can be made without determining which option — to expand or not to expand boundaries — will result in the least damage to the environment and then choosing that one. Councillors must undertake a meticulous emissions evaluation of each of the options and do their part to help avert or at least mitigate the climate crisis facing us all.
Joanne Lewis, Hamilton
Only determined action will do
Over two years ago, on June 17, 2019, the Trudeau government declared a national climate emergency. At that time scientists reported that Canada was warming at twice the global average. That figure has likely grown.
Since then the government has done little or nothing to reduce emissions locally or reduce exports of fossil fuels which, when burned, may result in even more greenhouse gas emissions annually than the already very high emissions that we report from activities on Canadian soil.
Canada must stop listening to the currently very powerful oil and gas lobby. Plans for any new projects must be halted immediately and those currently extracting oil and gas must be wound down.
Fossil fuel workers deserve a just transition to well-paid clean energy jobs and they are increasingly demanding one. They understand. Ending fossil fuel subsidies and other supports now, will release almost $18 billion annually. This will be a good start.
I am beyond frustrated with the Trudeau government’s inaction. Words alone cannot fix this. Only determined action at a governmental level.
Eileen Shannon, Dundas
Who needs vaccine passports?
When I had my second vaccination I also received a small certificate from the Ministry of Health stating the date and type of vaccine I had. This folds up quite small and I keep it with my health card in my wallet. Other than the fact that Trudeau loves wasting taxpayers money why is there all this talk about vaccine passports? I like millions of others already have proof of being fully vaccinated.
Dave Mechar, Waterdown
Once again, Ford knows best
Here we go again. Almost all top health leaders, plus the business community, agrees we need vaccine passports, but Doug Ford insists he knows better. Once again, deciding the wrong things for reasons of self interest. That is not leadership.
Andrea McDowell, Burlington
Not a split society, just a safe one
Ontario needs a vaccination passport. It will give people peace of mind when visiting restaurants, concerts, sporting events and any places where a number of people gather. By doing this you will not create two societies as Doug Ford has suggested. What it will do though, is give people who enjoy those events listed (and more) a sense of safety. The easiest way to do the passport is with a special sticker placed on your OHIP card. Everyone in Ontario has a card- whether you are two 102. these stickers can either be mailed out or picked up at the local Service Ontario office.
Gord Miranda, Hamilton
Open border will save tourism
To everyone whining about the border being opened to vaccinated Americans: The feds did this to save the tourism and hospitality sector, literally, save our lives. Try thinking of someone besides yourselves sometime.
Alecia Marsalis, Hamilton
Border reopening should work the other way
As we seem to be getting some grip on COVID and at the same time it’s starting to ramp up dramatically south of our border, can someone explain to me why have we opened our borders to Americans but they have not opened them to us (not that I want to go there)? Is it just me who feels it should be the other way around. Our leaders at work, inspiring.

Article content Is Canada doing enough at its international borders to protect the country from potentially COVID-19 positive travellers spreading the virus after they arrive? Premier Doug Ford of Ontario certainly doesn’t think so. At a freewheeling news conference Monday, Ford lashed out at the federal government for its poor management of people arriving at Canada’s major airports, especially Toronto’s Pearson. He suggested that arriving passengers were not sufficiently screened and that many, he claimed up to 25 per cent, were not observing the 14-day mandatory quarantine.

This stands in stark contrast with the Canada-U.S. land border, which has essentially been sealed since March for all but the most essential of purposes.

Article content When I returned from India in the spring, the lax approach at Pearson was evident. Even at that early stage of the crisis, many countries had restricted travel from hot spots such as China, and were rigorously screening and contact tracing those who had arrived. Meanwhile, arriving in Toronto, passengers were asked perfunctory screening questions and the follow-up was non-existent in many cases. Based on conversations I have had recently with some passengers who have returned from overseas, this situation has not changed much. Such laxity at this stage of the crisis is an indictment of the federal government’s apparent lack of seriousness in protecting Canada’s borders. It is not just the poor quality of control at the border, there is also no real control on who is allowed entry. In theory, Canada has strict rules that permit only citizens and permanent residents the right to return. In practice, holders of work permits, student visas, as well as the extended families of Canadian residents have been allowed to enter on compassionate grounds. Contrast this approach with Germany, where, apart from citizens and permanent residents of the European Union (EU), there is a strict and rigorously specified list of who may enter, such as scientists and researchers whose services are indispensable and who cannot perform their jobs from abroad.

Article content Is Canada being compassionate or has it become a chump? After cases in Canada spiked in the fall, the EU took Canada off its safe list of countries whose citizens are allowed to enter, but Canada took no such reciprocal action even though cases in Europe were also going up. The upshot is that it is easier for a German to visit Canada than it is for a Canadian to visit Germany. More On This Topic Bill Blair refutes Ontario’s border security criticism, touts Canada's 'strong' COVID-19 restrictions Ford rips Trudeau government for failing to secure border as Ontario imposes strict new lockdowns It is not just advanced G7 countries such as Germany that are doing much better than Canada at the borders. Even a developing country such as India has much more rigorous control on who is allowed to enter. Passengers who have proof of a negative COVID-19 test no earlier than 72 hours are exempt from quarantine. Passengers who don’t have a negative test have the option of a test on arrival at India’s major airports, and if they’re negative, they’re exempt from quarantine. But, in the absence of either of these, passengers are subject to a mandatory seven-day “institutional quarantine” in a government-approved facility where compliance can be monitored and an additional seven days of home quarantine ordered. Likewise, Germany has had COVID-19 testing on arrival at its airports in place at least since July while Canada has only rolled out pilot testing in Toronto and Calgary about six weeks ago.

Article content Meanwhile, Canada seems to have an “open house” sign at all of the major airports, by continuing to allow passengers to enter even from known hot spots, including India and some European countries, without any testing and with quarantine and contact tracing whose enforcement is a joke at best. Ironically, it’s easier for a grandparent in India to be reunited with their family in Canada than it is for a grandparent in Ontario to be reunited with their family in Quebec. In response to Ford’s biting criticism, Canada’s Health Minister, Patty Hajdu, has claimed that only 1.3 per cent of COVID-19 cases in Ontario are linked to passengers arriving from abroad. One could argue that this statistic is an underestimate, given how sophisticated the contact tracing would need to be, not just on international but on all connecting domestic flights and ground transport, to accurately capture anyone infected either directly or indirectly from someone arriving from abroad. Be that as it may, given the scale of the pandemic, if simple and proven measures such as widespread testing on arrival and controlling who is allowed to enter to reduce the risk of new infections originating from abroad could eliminate 1.3 per cent of new cases, why is the federal government failing to protect Canadians by neglecting to implement such basic measures?

Likewise, today’s public health emergency, and how governments and citizens respond to it, will be a catalyst for a transformed society. To survive and triumph, we must maintain and strengthen civic trust. We should not underestimate the scale of this challenge. The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to harm a large number of Quebecers and Canadians. Among other strategies, public health officials and government leaders are pleading with citizens to practise physical distancing. This measure represents an unprecedented disruption to daily life in peace time. The threat of the pandemic combined with the severe limiting of social interactions is an immense strain on even the most stoic of individuals, and the potential for long-term mental health consequences is deeply troubling.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content To facilitate and enforce physical distancing, much commercial activity has ceased and governments have placed significant restrictions on the movement of citizens. All of these developments are accompanied by extraordinary risks. The shutdown of our economy has had a disproportionate impact on vulnerable Canadians, and the projected recession threatens to deepen income inequality. State restrictions on individual freedom, even those made in the inarguable interest of the public good, could end up aiding those who practise what pollster Frank Graves calls “ authoritarian populism. ” The potential frailty of a post-pandemic society may be further exacerbated by whatever dominant narrative takes hold upon the containment of the virus. Overcoming misinformation and escaping a perception of failure if fatalities soar or overreaction if they do not may prove difficult and have disastrous consequences for public trust in science, evidence and institutions.

Article content Fortunately, civic trust so far appears to be holding and a majority of us say we are following the advice of public health officials. Yet Canada is not entirely insulated from the forces of division and exploitation. An eco-system of alt-right media and activists are using concerns over traveller transmission of the virus to perpetuate anti-refugee rhetoric; the gun industry is benefitting from unfounded fears of civil unrest; oil companies are trying to leverage the pandemic to escape the carbon tax, the centre of the country’s climate change plan; and there is a growing chorus of voices attacking public health evidence. We cannot tolerate ignorance peddlers and panic profiteers dissuading us from common sense and the common good.

Article content Recognizing that our own ability to evade the virus is partially dependent on the diligence of those we have been arguing with on social media is sobering. It is why civility, patience and solidarity are imperative in this moment. So rather than raising voices and pointing fingers, let us imagine a better future. For example, what if we could use this necessary pause to re-evaluate how we prioritize work and family, profit and service, individualism and community, and develop public policies to reflect a better equilibrium? What if we could leverage our renewed reliance on public health evidence to declare the information age the era of science and reason, and usher in exciting new possibilities for solving societal problems?

Article content To some of you, it may appear as if the COVID-19 pandemic is nearly over. To many others, that we are entering a catastrophic variants-driven third wave. Right now, either of these fates are possible. It is through the leadership provided by the government and our collective choices in the next few weeks that we will determine the path taken.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content Relaxing restrictions on private gatherings and congregated worship just as the COVID variants of concern (VOCs) are exponentially spreading in Regina is the exact opposite of what our government should be doing . And to focus on how many people will be vaccinated in the coming months is like telling someone not to worry about the wildfire racing toward their home because firefighters will be there by next week. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: Vaccines going well, but we need to do more to stop COVID-19 spread in Saskatchewan Back to video Yes, vaccinations are going well and the news that Phase 2 is beginning ahead of schedule is a spark of hope . But we cannot rely on vaccination alone to save us. People do not develop immunity to the virus until two to three weeks after they are vaccinated, and it will still be months before most of our population is protected individually to protect us all, collectively. That gives the super-spreading variants plenty of time to create a third wave. Not only are the VOCs more easily spread, but epidemiological evidence informs us that B.1.1.7 is more transmissible and deadly than the original strain . This variant has quickly become dominant in Regina and it will soon be dominant throughout the province. As B.1.1.7 takes over, the number of cases will rise and so would hospitalizations and deaths. High immunization rates in our seniors should help decrease the worst outcomes in this age group, but it is a mistake to think that middle-aged and younger adults have nothing to worry about. Severe illness and death have happened in all age groups, especially with B.1.1.7. What’s more, about one in 10 people who have had COVID is still unwell three months later, and doctors know little about how to help these individuals.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content The good news is that the spread of VOCs can be slowed by the same public health measures that have worked throughout the pandemic. The bad news is that because VOCs are more easily transmitted, stopping them requires that these measures be implemented and enforced more stringently — and very quickly — while there is still time. Saskatchewan has consistently implemented the least-strict protective measures in Canada. This has no chance of working against the variants. Our current measures are giving the VOCs a chance to reverse the gains we have made in recent months. We need to take a tougher approach to buy the time required for vaccines to kick in. We know no one wants to hear this. We wish that mere optimism would guarantee our success. The way to guarantee success isn’t through wishes, but through a concerted effort to beat this virus. From provincial leadership, all the way down to each interaction between two people, every action counts. As scientists, we can only share our best understanding of what is happening, based on our training and analysis of current research, but it is up to all of us to implement these strategies of success. We must do all we can to reduce the spread of VOCs, until everyone has had the chance to be vaccinated. Many people in Saskatchewan have reduced their contact with others above and beyond what the government has deemed safe, to protect themselves and others. We applaud these efforts and urge everyone to adhere to the following guidelines:
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content Avoid travel outside of your city or town for now;
Avoid close contact with anyone outside your household;
Minimize in-person shopping and choose take-out or delivery over restaurant dining. Stay out of bars.
Work from home, or allow your employees to work from home, and attend virtual worship services only;
Parents of school-age children who are attending classes, consider switching to online learning
When you are around others outside your household, wear a high-quality, tight-fitting mask;
Enjoy outdoor activities and visits safely by keeping your distance from others and consider wearing a mask if others may be nearby. We did this a year ago, and we can do it again, one last time. As important as individual actions are, we need our provincial government to do its part, too. Since last summer, our premier has consistently resisted putting in place the measures that have been shown to reduce viral spread. In Canada, Saskatchewan has had the highest per capita case-rate for over 60 days straight in 2021. The high rate of cases in our province compared to all other parts of the country shows that more aggressive approach is needed. Now, relaxing restrictions, combined with little enforcement to ensure public health orders are followed, has opened the door for VOCs to run rampant. A third wave will prolong the pandemic and all its negative consequences: More deaths, more suffering including mental health and long-term effects, and more economic impacts. It doesn’t have to be this way. Continue the vaccine rollout and do what has been shown to work: Introduce stricter measures now to rein in a VOC-driven third wave of the pandemic in Saskatchewan.

Article content It has not happened yet, but it is inevitable that we will have a public debate in Canada about whether, in the words of U.S. President Donald Trump, the restrictions that have been imposed in response to the COVID-19 crisis is a case of “the cure being worse than the disease.” Thankfully, no major Canadian political figure has made such a claim.

Article content However, there are certain pro-business and right-wing voices that have started to make this very case. See, for example, a recent column by Conrad Black or the twitter feed of Brett Wilson. In contrast, despite the restrictions that are already in place, there are some public health professionals and scientists, who argue that existing restrictions might have to last 18 or 24 months and some are demanding even more restrictions. This debate is currently at the margins, but there will be a time — maybe in a couple of weeks; maybe in a couple of months — when the debate goes into the mainstream. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: Health vs. economy debate will come, but it's a false choice Back to video Of course, framing the debate as health care versus the economy is a false choice. Ending restrictions on businesses and public gatherings will not automatically restart the economy. Not if billions of dollars more need to be dedicated to health care to deal with the hundreds of thousands of cases and the tens of thousands of deaths (or more). Likewise, how will businesses function with a workforce and customers depleted due to COVID-19? Or people scared to go to work or shop because of the threat of COVID-19. Likewise, there is plenty of economic activity that needs to occur despite the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic. People still need to eat, so we cannot shut down the agriculture sector and grocery stores. People still need electricity and home heating, so we cannot shut down the energy sector.

Article content Nevertheless, when the rate of increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths starts to slow down or even reverse, there will be calls for restrictions to be lifted. The danger is that we may have just survived the first wave, and the possibility of a second wave intensifies if we move too quickly to reopen society. Conversely, we cannot indefinitely place harsh restrictions on society. At a certain point, some, if not all, are going to need to be lifted. Regardless of when this debate occurs in a serious way, there are a number of key political science concepts that are going to come into play: authority and legitimacy. Authority is a form of power in which people obey commands not because they have been rationally or emotionally persuaded, or because they fear the consequences of disobedience, but simply because they respect the source of the command. The one who issues the command is accepted as having a right to do so, and those who receive the command accept that they have an obligation to obey. Authority is focused in the one who commands, but legitimacy is the feeling of respect for authority that exists in those who obey — it is what makes authority possible. In other words, people have to trust the source of the command. This is especially critical in times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Article content A major challenge in how the United States is responding to COVID-19 is that many Americans do not trust the leadership of President Trump. His flip-flopping on policies and his narcissism has prevented Trump from taking the leadership role that naturally occurs in crises. The situation is very different in Canada. Even people who strongly oppose Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or Premier Jason Kenney have accepted their decisions. However, this could start to shift if people cease respecting authority. This could be because they do not trust the information provided, do not accept the rationale for severe restrictions, or believe that the decisions issued by authorities are harming them. Canada has enacted the most draconian restrictions in living memory. The Second World War may have led to the rationing of food, gasoline and other materials, but there were no social distancing requirements. Yet Canadians have largely obeyed these restrictions, because they believe that the orders are coming from a legitimate authority and accept their rationale of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Canadian state simply lacks the coercive power to enforce these restrictions in the absence of voluntary compliance. If you want to see what happens when society does not voluntarily comply with laws, just look at underage smoking and drinking, and, until its recent legalization, cannabis use.

Article content For those who argued that Canada should have acted quicker and closed our borders (stranding Canadians outside of the country) or shutting down schools and restaurants back in January or February, you need to consider whether society would have voluntarily complied at that time. When the inevitable debate about reopening the economy occurs, a major factor will be whether the existing restrictions can be sustained in the absence of voluntary compliance.

Article content This month marks the one-year anniversary of the COVID-19 pandemic’s arrival in Canada. The year has transformed our lives in very significant and difficult ways. The loss of friends and family members to the virus, absence of social contact, ever-present fear of getting sick and challenges to our general mental health have made life very difficult.

Article content At the beginning of the pandemic, much attention was paid to those whose work involved significant risk. Health-care workers were considered “heroes” and their contributions were regularly recognized. It soon became clear that COVID-19 was not going to disappear quickly and the restrictions we all faced led to “pandemic fatigue.” The focus inevitably and understandably went from acknowledging those working on the front lines to personal survival.

If you have ever had an X-ray, a CT scan, an MRI, or radiation therapy as part of your cancer treatment, you’ve seen an MRT. You probably did not know they were called MRTs. They know and have come to expect this. The pandemic has revealed something far more concerning: many in important decision-making roles such as ministers of health, senior policymakers and even those running hospitals also do not know who MRTs are and what they do. Which is why MRTs had to fight for access to the protective gear that doctors and nurses were given without a thought. It is also why MRTs were not prioritized in many provincial vaccination rollout plans.

Article content Across Canada, health-care providers are now receiving their first or second dose of the vaccine. A survey conducted by the Canadian Association of Medical Radiation Technologists (CAMRT) this month revealed that vaccines have been given to 90 per cent of MRTs in Manitoba, 80 per cent in British Columbia, and 68 per cent in Ontario have received at least one dose of vaccine. MRTs are rightly breathing a sigh of relief after a year of relentless pressure and uncertainty. But not in Alberta. In Alberta, the number of MRTs having received a jab less than five per cent at the time of writing. Yes, you read that correctly: less than five per cent. And yet, most, if not all, people confirmed to have COVID-19 have chest X-rays taken by MRTs.

Article content MRTs are in contact with virtually all people testing positive for the novel coronavirus; it is hard to imagine that anyone could argue that this is not a dangerous profession at the moment. How has the Alberta government not recognized this dangerous oversight? Are Alberta MRTs somehow magically at lower risk than those working in other provinces? Are vulnerable patients less likely to contract COVID-19 from an MRT in Alberta who contracts the virus because they have not been vaccinated? Of course not. The implementation of the Government of Alberta’s vaccine rollout plan is not working. Frontline professionals with exposure to COVID-19, like MRTs, must be vaccinated now. I have written to the Alberta minister of health twice in my capacity as CEO of the CAMRT. I have received no response. The 2,300 MRTs in the province are being overlooked and ignored. They deserve better. Albertans deserve better. I sincerely hope that exposing this fact in a public way will catch the minister’s attention and convince his office to take action. Lives depend on it. Irving Gold is the chief executive officer of the Canadian Association of Medical Radiation Technologists.

Article content As September approaches, children and families in Saskatchewan are turning their attention to the new school year. While school supplies and new clothes remain part of the back-to-school tradition, this year the return to in-class learning will also coincide with a significant rise in cases of COVID-19 in Saskatchewan from the Delta variant. Parents are anxiously waiting to hear from their school divisions as to the safety protocols that will be in place when school begins.

Article content The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 is a very different virus than what our province has previously faced. It is 55 per cent more transmissible than the Alpha variant which caused a surge of cases this spring, and twice as transmissible as the ancestral strain we faced in 2020. With the rise in cases, Saskatchewan has seen the first two weeks of August, particularly in Saskatoon, there is no question that our fourth wave of COVID-19 has begun. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: School divisions need to have some health measures in place to combat Delta variant Back to video The impact of the pandemic thus far on children and adolescents as a result of school restrictions has been uniformly negative, with downstream impacts on parents and families. Experts in pediatrics and public health universally agree that in-class learning and in-person school attendance must be prioritized at nearly any cost, and school closures with remote learning must only be a measure of last resort to control a pandemic surge. Delta is now surging in parts of the southern United States . Children and school staff are being infected and quarantined at remarkable rates. Given that the risk of in-school transmission of Delta increases as community transmission rates rise, these outcomes are not surprising, especially in the absence of universal mitigating measures such as masks. Although Saskatchewan’s vaccine uptake is better than the worst-affected parts of the United States, given the limited public health measures currently in place in our province, we expect a surge of cases from Delta soon. When this occurs, the transmission risk in Saskatchewan schools will increase accordingly.

Article content Saskatchewan was relatively fortunate during the 2020-21 school year. Solid evidence-based safety protocols were in place, including universal masking, physical distancing, daily symptom checks, stay-at-home protocols and liberal testing combined with timely contact tracing. School closures were limited. Despite vaccines for COVID-19 not being available most of the 2020-21 school year, limited in-school transmission of COVID-19 occurred. According to an epidemiologic analysis released by the Saskatchewan Health Authority in late May to inform decision-making for Regina-area schools, of 1,299 cases identified as being school-associated in Regina, only about 10 per cent of these were most likely acquired in the school setting. This strongly suggests that control measures in schools during the 2020-21 school year worked very well to limit transmission of COVID-19. There is no justification for not doing everything to protect Saskatchewan children and schools through the entirety of the 2021-22 school year. There are more than 180,000 children under the age of 12 in Saskatchewan who remain ineligible for vaccine , a reality which will not change until likely sometime this winter. Returning to in-class learning with no safety measures in place other than for enhanced cleaning protocols would mean that nearly all children involved in in-class learning would be exposed to Delta, and many (especially those under age 12 who remain unvaccinated) would be infected. While most children do not develop severe illness even with Delta, a small number will require hospitalization and critical care support, a smaller number may die. Even if we chose to heartlessly trivialize this reality, we would still not be considering the significant impact of illness and disability on children and their families, the trauma induced through medical care, or short- and long-term mental health effects.

Article content Local medical health officers (MHOs) have been tasked through the pandemic with the responsibility of providing recommendations to teachers, educational leaders and school divisions regarding appropriate safety measures and protocols based on local epidemiologic trends. While we await further guidance from the ministries of Education and Health, that responsibility continues into the 2021-22 school year. As we trust our teachers and educational leaders implicitly to provide the best approaches to teaching our children, we must also trust our local MHOs who are experts in providing the necessary guidance to keep schools open and our children safe throughout the pandemic. The evidence for keeping schools safe includes universal masking, distancing and cohorting as able, improved ventilation for teaching settings that have yet to do so, and zero-barrier access to vaccination for all who are eligible, including family members. We are confident the recommendations from local MHOs will be clear, unambiguous, and follow the best science currently available. We are both parents of young children who attend daycares and schools in Saskatchewan, and we both see no present issue more important than protecting the safety of our province’s children and keeping our province’s schools open for in-class learning as much as possible. We remind all Saskatchewan citizens to do their part by getting fully vaccinated in order to limit community transmission of Delta, which in turn will limit in-school transmission of Delta. We ask our teachers, educational leaders, and school divisions to follow the recommendations of their local MHOs to provide the safest learning environment possible.

Article content To use an educational analogy, we feel much of this is similar to getting the correct answers in advance of the test. We have enough shared experience in Saskatchewan and across North America to know exactly the challenge Delta poses and how we must respond. All that is needed from our teachers, educational leaders and school divisions is the courage and leadership to follow the recommendations of our public health leaders to the letter. Dr. Carla Holinaty is a family physician in Saskatoon. Dr. Alexander Wong is an infectious disease physician in Regina. The news seems to be flying at us faster all the time.

Article content Montreal universities have announced that students will return to campus for in-person classes this September. While it is not yet known what impact the fourth wave of COVID-19 and vaccine passport discussions will have, all indications are that Canada will welcome more international students than last year .

Article content Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada reported a 17-per-cent decline in international students’ enrolment in 2020 because of the pandemic. In 2018, international students’ economic contributions were valued at $21.6 billion, leading many to wonder how Canadian universities and colleges would survive without their financial support. While this concern might be valid, using a solely financial lens overlooks the tremendous cultural diversity these students bring to every community. A more proactive question to ask is: How can we better serve international students so that Canada attracts more international enrolment? We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Some had to pack up and fly home in a single day after being notified about the closure of their dorms and countries’ borders. Other students were prevented from entering Canada, requiring them to carry out their studies in a different time zone. Imagine paying four times the domestic tuition rate only to have to wake up daily at 4 a.m. to attend online classes.

Article content Studying under these circumstances brought on by the pandemic will have a lasting impact on the psychological and emotional well-being of international students, on top of the obstacles they more commonly faced before. My research has shown that international students experience greater anxiety and isolation than domestic students, while having access to less social support. Adapting to new academic and living environments is challenging and they often need institutional support to deal with the culture shock. Educational institutions should become more mindful of this vulnerable population and promote such appropriate accommodations as academic counselling, peer support study groups and student mental health services, where possible.

Article content As a short-term plan, government and educational institutions should consider how to welcome international students by prioritizing their safety during and after their journey to Canada. They might need to arrive early to self-isolate if they are not fully vaccinated or their COVID-19 vaccines are not approved by Canadian authorities . If they get sick during their travel, they might not have access to health insurance before the official start date of their program. All universities and colleges should offer quarantine packages and health resources. If some international students cannot come to Canada due to delays in obtaining study permits or travel restrictions , educational institutions should be prepared to offer alternatives, such as allowing them to start their program remotely.

Article content As a long-term plan, universities and colleges should build support teams to counter the isolation and hold networking activities to accommodate the unique social needs of international students. Mobilizing mentors or fellow students might help them to better handle their culture shock. Finally, both government and universities should play a substantial role in removing any financial burdens. As an international graduate student, I am aware that there are many federal funding opportunities (e.g. SSHRC, NSERC, etc.) not available to international students. In 2017, Quebec has removed barriers of citizenship or permanent residence status in application requirements to its provincial research fund (FRQSC, FRQNT, etc.). Similar changes can be put into action by the federal government. All students in Canada should have access to these grants and scholarships, especially as they contribute so much both during and after their studies to the Canadian economic and social life.

No, prepare for multiple worsts – and better scenarios, too Back to video The pandemic also has brought unprecedented uncertainty. This isn’t a rhetorical point. There are organizations and researchers who use different methodologies to track uncertainty over time. They find that the level of uncertainty in recent months has been the highest ever recorded in Canada, the United States and elsewhere. This uncertainty makes it extremely difficult for governments to produce reliable economic and fiscal projections. In particular, it makes it challenging to estimate how much revenue they’ll bring in and how much they’ll spend on health care and other front-line departments in the fight against the pandemic.

Article content The pandemic has brought unprecedented uncertainty As a result, Canadian governments have delayed the release of their 2020 budgets. Instead, the federal and provincial governments have produced short-term fiscal updates and sought legislative approval for emergency spending on an as-needed basis. The strategy was ostensibly to wait until the situation had stabilized. But the situation hasn’t markedly improved. A recent spike in cases and new rounds of business restrictions have health experts speculating about a “long, dark winter.” The need to live with uncertainty is the one certainty that policy-makers and the public can anticipate for foreseeable future. It’s against this backdrop that Ontario Finance Minister Rod Phillips is set to release his government’s budget on Thursday . It will take stock of the pandemic’s impact on Ontario’s public finances and provide Ontarians with an update on the government’s plan to address the pandemic’s economic and public health challenges.

Article content Photo by John Lappa/Postmedia News The pandemic, including the uncertainty it has wrought, has already contributed to a significant worsening of Ontario’s bottom line. The government’s own-source revenue projections fell by more than $10 billion between March and August 2020. Expenditures jumped by $20 billion over the same time frame. The effect was a six-fold increase in the province’s current deficit in barely five months. The Ontario government won’t be able to eliminate uncertainty in its forthcoming budget. But there are steps it can take to mitigate its effects and, in turn, to minimize the risk that the deficit climbs even further. As we outline in a new paper for Ontario 360, a research project at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, one of the most useful ways in which the provincial government — or any government, for that matter — can address uncertainty in its budget is to adopt “scenario analysis.”
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content This is a prudent approach in light of current circumstances It sounds wonky but the basic idea is straightforward. Normally, governments rely on a single set of economic and fiscal forecasts as the foundation of their budgets. Scenario analysis would have them produce a range of scenarios that reflect the level of uncertainty in the economy. This is a prudent approach in light of current circumstances. The risk of reliance on a single economic and fiscal outlook is that it gets overtaken by events and the budget is rendered, for all intents and purposes, useless from an accountability and public reporting perspective. The government’s fiscal credibility would be seriously harmed in the eyes of bond markets, credit rating agencies and the general public. Scenario analysis, by contrast, would have the government produce different economic and fiscal scenarios — a base case, an upside case, and a downside case, most typically — that provide it with more fiscal flexibility in such a fluid environment. This protects the government’s budget against significant changes in the public-health and economic environments and sets the stage for the government to propose different policy responses contingent on the different scenarios.

Article content Scenario analysis and contingency planning can contribute to greater public confidence Scenario analysis and contingency planning can contribute to greater public confidence that the government has a proactive plan rather than a series of reactive responses to the evolving pandemic. Sustaining such confidence will be crucial as any government continues to make difficult choices in order to manage the pandemic. Peer jurisdictions are using scenario analysis and contingency planning to mitigate uncertainty and shore up public confidence. The Eurozone, for instance, has experimented with this budgeting approach amid the pandemic. So much is outside of the Ontario government’s control as it prepares to release its budget this week. But it can control how it takes into account today’s unprecedented uncertainty.

Opinion: As far as politics goes, the COVID-19 pandemic changes everything. Or does it? Marie-Eve Desrosiers and Philippe Lagassé: It is not hard to see mistrust remerging as a potent political force
Article content By Marie-Eve Desrosiers and Philippe Lagassé Things will never be the same. This is a common refrain these days. Faced with the massive impact of COVID-19 on our lives, the economy, and our relationship with government, it is hard to think that our societies will go back to “normal.” The pandemic will eventually pass. And when it does, there are reasons to hope that doubts about expertise and the role of government, as well as the conditions that breed economic inequality, might be alleviated. We are seeing scientists take centre stage and policy being crafted based on the best possible evidence at hand. Trust in government and political leaders is increasing in Canada and there’s a growing sense of common cause, with well-paid professionals appreciating how much their lives depend on the poorly paid and precariously employed. Surely this will lead to a renewed embrace of expert advice, a positive role for government, and a commitment to reduce inequality when this is all over.

Article content But as pivotal as the moment seems, we should not forget that it comes at a time when trust in governments, expertise, and the economic system has been declining. Rather than changing everything, the COVID-19 pandemic might amplify this longer standing, less obvious crisis and the discords that have fuelled it. The respect shown toward public health officials and evidence-based policies at the moment is heartening. But it is not hard to see mistrust remerging as a potent political force. Questions about when travelling restrictions were imposed and based on what evidence are percolating. Debates about rates of infection in certain age groups or about whether asymptomatic people should be wearing masks are leading many to doubt what they are being told and to ask whether authorities are engaging in “noble lying.” Many commentators have noticed that official policies were reversed in a matter of days and weeks, leading to doubts about the quality of the evidence that informed government positions.

Article content Many commentators have noticed that official policies were reversed in a matter of days and weeks The reality, of course, is that policy-makers always act based on imperfect information, particularly in rapidly evolving crises. Similarly, expertise is not omnipotence and there is an understandable hesitance to act contrary to what others in professional networks and international institutions are recommending. During a crisis, the need to show unity may even trump the careful consideration of alternative approaches. This is one way in which the battle against COVID-19 does resemble a war: those who are waging it are caught in a fog, working with the best information they have and the strategies they judge most appropriate, even if their approach ends up being faulty. Under the circumstances and the muddling through they require, no government will find itself above criticism. While solidarity and support are widespread today, they might give way to scrutiny and resentment, as citizens demand to know why states were not better prepared or hesitant to act sooner.

Article content But this could take a deeper form. The connection between populist politics and distrust in expertise and government is evident. Populist movements that have gained prominence across the world in the past decade have fed off the sense of disconnect people feel between their interests and values and those that are championed by governing elites and experts. Those who are already skeptical of technocratic government and officially sanctioned expertise could see their views reinforced as leaders do their best to work with the information and evidence they have available to them. Although many are applauding the return of “big government” and the central role of experts in responding to the crisis, in the long run responses to COVID-19 may feed populist fears. Populists may see this as another example of “elites” making decisions — and mistakes — far removed from everyday people and their right to make their own decisions.

Article content Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post Perhaps the social solidarity the pandemic is fostering will keep the scrutiny and resentment at bay. But we should remember that these are early days and that, as is quickly becoming apparent, not all are living the crisis in the same way. Long-standing divides may reappear once the full economic impact of the crisis, and the steps that are needed to pay for the emergency payments that were enacted, become evident. The disproportionate burdens and risks the pandemic will place on the least privileged is increasingly being recognized. Yesterday’s job precarity has already translated into deep economic uncertainty for significant segments of the population under COVID-19. New government programs will help buffer economic hardships for now, but it will likely take years for many to recover what they have lost or will lose. As importantly, many will be dismayed if governments rush to re-establish the previous economic order. Those who already felt left behind before the pandemic risk feeling once again overlooked if government and business leaders strive to return to a status quo ante that rebuilds the economic structures many felt marginalized them or discredited their contribution to society.

Article content Photo by Sebastian Castaneda/Reuters Those who benefited from the world as it was, in turn, may feel they need to defend what they once had. Loss aversion may be powerful force in the coming years, and it could exacerbate the ideological split over income inequality, taxes, deficits/debt, and the overall role of the government in the economy and society. As noted, the fight against COVID-19 has been likened to a war. So far, Canadians appear to be “rallying around the flag,” doing what it takes to flatten the curve and support front-line workers and those who have lost their livelihoods. But it may be too optimistic to hope that the pandemic will “change everything” when it comes to attitudes about government and expertise, and the political factionalism that has marked Western democracies recently. From our admittedly pessimistic perspective, the pandemic may worsen the deeper crisis our political and economic institutions were already facing.

We write this article out of love and to remind everybody of our responsibility towards creating a society that values the health of all, and especially, of the particular needs of the young, who often have no voice but will take over the reins of our society.

Even now, with schools reopened, many schools are not providing the full-time service that our young people deserve and need in order to thrive. Some return to school plans include as little as 105 minutes per day of in-person learning. This limited time is not only inadequate to meet curricular milestones and prepare students for the rigours of university, it also leaves them isolated for hours every day and deprives them of the socialization they need to develop into healthy adults. Almost all universities are offering only online classes and denying access to places on campus that allow social and academic interactions.

Article content Youth and young adulthood is the time that people develop the skills and relationships that last their lifetimes. The people we meet in high school, university, at our first job, or wherever else young adulthood brings us, become friends for life. This is also the time we fall in love, fail, and fall in love again with the hope that we will eventually get it right. We learn what real friendship means as we navigate the chasm between childhood and adulthood. Recent years have seen young people increasingly struggle with this transition. The medical and statistical truth is that the young are not at risk from COVID-19. Compared to other common respiratory infections like influenza, COVID-19 is less deadly and less likely to result in hospitalization for those under age 30.

In comparison, COVID-19 has been associated with two deaths under the age of 20 and nine deaths among those between 20 and 29. Further, it’s not clear how many of those deaths were due to COVID, rather than due to another cause with COVID as an incidental finding. In fact, the risk of dying of COVID for the young is hundreds of times less than dying of other things, an event which is, mercifully, already rare. While COVID-19 does not pose a significant health threat to children and youth, our response does. Suicides claim the lives of close to 4,000 young Canadians per year. In June 2020, more young Canadians died in one month alone from opioid overdoses than in the entire province of B.C. from COVID-19.

Article content But those deaths are not being announced on a daily basis on social media. Increased distress associated with loss of social structure and educational opportunity is predicted to substantially increase this number. Even a 1% increase in suicide would mean 40 more deaths in young people, which is four times more than COVID has claimed. This doesn’t include the increase in drownings, deaths due to inability to access medical care, or other unintended consequences. We are also forgetting the enormous economic impact reduced education and increased public debt will impose on our youth. Yet we have demonized young people who wish to socialize. Those who are caught are paraded out on the media for group shaming, or receive hefty fines. We have ensured that the common places that young people would be able to meet are unavailable — schools, universities and athletic venues — especially for those who cannot afford private lessons or clubs.

The costs of restriction are higher, and will last longer, for this group. If anxiety and depression was high already, increased isolation, lack of supports and economic distress will increase it further. In Canada, around 80% of COVID-19 deaths have occurred in nursing homes. The argument to impose restrictions on the young is that if they become infected, the infections will inevitably percolate to the elderly, causing deaths. However, it is not because a 20-year-old university student goes to a seminar with 20 classmates that her grandmother will be infected. There are many opportunities to avoid this, by improving care in nursing homes, ensuring people avoid visiting the elderly when sick, and ensuring that those caring for them have sufficient security that they are not incentivized to come to work while ill.

Article content Many will argue that choosing between children and the elderly is a false dichotomy, and it is. There is no reason that we can’t ensure our children have what they need while also providing excellent care for our elders. We propose that we do both by ensuring adequate funding for elder care and carefully considering how important it is to ensure the mental, physical and emotional health of the people whom we have pledged our lives to raise and protect. — Dr. Mary Kestler is an infectious diseases specialist and clinical assistant professor in the UBC Faculty of Medicine. — Dr. Jennifer M.

Ontario was the first province to administer the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to a Toronto-based personal support worker Anita Quidangen. This week, 14 sites across the 10 provinces will be receiving Canada’s first 30,000 doses. None of those sites are in northwestern Ontario.

Does that surprise anyone? It doesn’t surprise me. We are used to being forgotten about, our big province sometimes feels like nothing exists outside the Greater Toronto Area.
The Northwestern Health Unit’s top doctor, Dr. Kit Young Hoon, said she was not concerned that the northwest would be lost in the fray of the vaccine rollout. That is encouraging to hear but being the cynic I am, I feel as if that may not end up being the case.
Northwestern Ontario is home to many remote communities that do not have regular, easy access to health care. Those communities, which could even include Kenora, should be a priority moving forward. I understand that this vaccine rollout will take time and we won’t be back to normal life for quite some time, but the northwest can’t be left behind.
Our case numbers are staying low despite high numbers in Manitoba and southern Ontario, but that shouldn’t mean we should be late to get the vaccine.
The province says by the end of January 2021 over 20 hospitals across Ontario will be administering the Pfizer vaccine. Will one of them be Lake of the Woods District Hospital? Who knows. It’s most likely too early to start predicting how things will play out."

Article content The federal election may be over, but don’t take your voter hat off just yet! That’s right: it’s municipal election time.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content Considering nearly 80 per cent of Alberta small businesses say issues related to their business have been largely ignored by their local governments, this upcoming municipal election is an opportunity for candidates to first change this perception and, second, have a vision that ensures small businesses can recover from the impacts of the pandemic and thrive in their local communities. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: Small business recovery needs to be a top issue for municipal candidates Back to video There is no time like the present for municipal candidates to act given the worrying position our small businesses are in. Only 33 per cent are back to normal sales. Those that have taken on COVID-related debt owe an average of nearly $335,000, and around one in five businesses remain at risk of closing. Those alarm bells you’re hearing? That’s the alarm to municipal candidates. Small business economic recovery needs to be one of their top priorities.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content The good news is we have seen municipal governments across Alberta step up and act quickly to help small businesses. Expedited patio permitting, reduced property taxes and grant supports are some examples that have all been helpful moves. But as the most recent round of provincial restrictions has shown us, we’re not out of the woods just yet. All of these measures need to continue and be made a focus in municipal elections to ensure economic recovery at the local level. In a recent survey, Alberta small business owners made it clear that their top priorities for municipal officials are to lower existing costs and commit to no new ones, especially as it relates to property taxes. Property taxes mark the highest municipal cost for local businesses. Nearly three-quarters of Alberta small business owners said lowering property taxes would help their business succeed. This makes sense given how low revenues have been during the pandemic. Remember: property taxes are profit insensitive. Businesses have to pay them whether or not they’re bringing in any revenue.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content In addition, over two-thirds of Alberta small businesses have seen an increase in their property taxes over the last four years. This should concern all municipalities, especially when 80 per cent of small businesses have not fully recovered. It has also caused nearly two in five (37 per cent) of small business owners to consider relocating altogether. Again, this should cause urgency for all municipalities to address property taxes in the upcoming election. There are some municipalities that have worked hard to create a fair property tax system. According to CFIB’s latest Alberta Municipal Watch Report, the municipality of Leduc, for example, has a near-perfect fairness ratio of 1:1 — meaning business owners pay a near equal portion of their property taxes to the proportion of commercial assessment values. Whereas the opposite is true in municipalities like Calgary, where businesses make up only 20 per cent of the property assessment share in the city, yet they are responsible for paying nearly half (46 per cent) of Calgary’s property taxes. Calgary doesn’t have to look far to find other municipalities within Alberta that have achieved property tax fairness. Now is the time for all municipalities to look inward at how they can create a fairer property tax system for business owners.

Article content The pandemic has reminded us how vital small businesses are to creating thriving, healthy communities. It is time for municipal candidates to pay attention to the issues and needs of small business owners. If we want a vibrant post-pandemic local economy full of cafes, local shopping, lunch and dinner dates, then it’s time for municipal governments to consider the costs we are putting on small businesses now. Reducing commercial property taxes is the best place to start. But there are also other ways to help support local businesses, like continuing to reduce red tape, reduce spending, ensure small businesses are not negatively impacted by municipal construction projects, and encourage and promote local shopping. These measures all put together are equally important to help to ensure our local businesses can recover and thrive in our communities. Business owners can sign CFIB’s own online petition — https://initiative.cfib-fcei.ca/alberta-municipal-elections/ — that asks all business owners what measures they would like to see addressed by their municipal candidates, such as, shop local campaigns, reducing red tape, addressing property taxes and creating a construction mitigation strategy.

Article content One fortunate aspect of COVID-19 is that children have been less directly affected by the disease. But despite the relatively low incidence of severe illness in children, the response to the pandemic may have long-term adverse effects on the health and well-being of children and adolescents.

We are concerned because some of the unintended consequences of the public health response to the pandemic are increased stressors for children and adolescents .

While some effects will be immediate, many will surface decades from now.

Article content For the more than 500,000 Canadian children under the age of 18 living in poverty (and one in four children in single-parent households) prior to the pandemic, the shocks have been great. As of June, the unemployment rate in Canada reached a record high of 13.7 per cent, with cumulative employment losses over three million since February. This is especially worrisome. One striking example shows that financial hardship in early life is related to higher risk of metabolic syndrome and physical health problems in adulthood, often independent of adult income and resources. The concern now is the extent to which these massive shocks will impact children’s lifelong health and well-being. Children and adolescents are facing these stressors without access to the stabilizing routines and activities that typically support their development. For adolescents, who need peer interaction to support development, social deprivation and reduced opportunities for social learning are likely to have far-reaching consequences on their development and mental health .

Article content Biological pathways Stressors stemming from the pandemic may become biologically imprinted in children and leave a lasting mark on child and adult health and well-being. There are several biological pathways that can be modulated by early life experiences, but epigenetics — a process that turns genes “on” or “off” — is particularly well-studied. Epigenetic changes associated with early experiences can last into adulthood and may be linked to stress, inflammation and chronic heath conditions. While scientists continue to map the exact mechanisms by which early experiences impact adult health, what is clear is that children who experience adversity early in life are at heightened risk for later mental, social and physical health problems. Additional protections for children and families are needed to prevent the negative effects of COVID-19 from following children, especially those already at greatest risk, into adulthood.

Helping children and adolescents thrive It’s not too late to prevent children and adolescents growing up in the pandemic from becoming unintended casualties.

Article content The presence of warm and supportive adults can protect children from stressful life events. Close bonds between parents and children are protective against the harmful, long-term effects of financial insecurity on the immune system — extending into adulthood. Grandparents, teachers, coaches, other important adults and close-knit communities in the lives of children are offering inspiring examples of how to creatively connect and support children digitally and in physically, but not socially, distanced ways. Creating opportunities for children and adolescents to be involved in the rebuilding plan can empower young people as leaders. A diverse youth advisory council, such as the Mental Health Commission of Canada’s Youth Council, can advocate by incorporating the wisdom and vision of young people’s lived experiences.

Article content We urge policy-makers to seek scientific evidence and consult with experts focused on child development, including pediatricians, psychologists and researchers in the biology of early life experiences. To start, policy-makers should invest in solutions to minimize the evidence-based Top 10 Threats outlined by Children First Canada. These include depression, anxiety and child abuse — all of which are amplified by the pandemic. Finally, we urge the creation of diverse federal and provincial pandemic recovery task forces to create an evidenced-based strategy for supporting children and adolescents. Institutions, educators and leading scientists also have a role to play in advocating for young people who do not vote, and as a result often do not have a voice in policy discussions. The late Dr. Clyde Hertzman, founding director of the Human Early Learning Partnership, was a tireless advocate for increasing investments in child health and education to prevent adversity in childhood from evolving into disease. His life motto of “it doesn’t have to be this way” has never been more relevant.

A successful Canadian vaccination campaign is firmly taking hold, and COVID-19 cases are dropping dramatically. The provinces are beginning to announce the lifting of restrictions. We finally seem to be turning the corner on a return to life as we know it — and that should include travel. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Most tourism in Canada happens in summer, and a broad spectrum of tourism-related businesses are facing a dire situation. Many won’t survive the loss of a second summer.

Article content The travel limitations the government implemented while COVID-19 was overwhelming Canada’s health-care system were appropriate and largely successful. Now, before it’s too late, the government should heed its own expert advisors and provide a timetable for a return to travel, based on advice from health officials, to salvage the summer season that is the lifeblood of so many Canadian workers and businesses. As public health and government officials have repeatedly told us, vaccinations are the most important element in getting back to normal life. After a slow start because of vaccine supply challenges, Canada is quickly becoming one of the most vaccinated countries in the world. Marriott International has joined Faster, Together, a coalition of labour, business and individuals encouraging Canadians to get vaccinated. We also introduced our Vaccination Care Program, which provides education, schedule flexibility, and a financial award at our managed hotels for employees who get vaccinated.

Article content The recent announcement lifting some quarantine restrictions for fully vaccinated Canadians and permanent residents offers some optimism. But it is a small first step and fails to give Canadians something to look forward to as the vaccination effort continues. In other G7 countries, guidance has been updated to allow for the resumption of most activities. Not everyone is ready to travel tomorrow, and it is important that we continue to follow public health advice. But Canadians should be given the opportunity to travel, without shame or anxiety, and within the confines of the safety protocols that have already proven successful. And fully vaccinated international travellers should once again be able to travel to Canada and enjoy the extraordinary destinations the country has to offer. At the moment, Canadians can travel outside their country yet are discouraged from travelling within Canada by a confusing patchwork of provincial restrictions, while even vaccinated international travellers remain prohibited from travelling to Canada. This simply doesn’t make sense.

Article content The travel industry has adopted extraordinary measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Marriott has spent the past 16 months implementing heightened hygiene and safety protocols as part of our “Commitment to Clean,” investing in “touchless” technologies, and refining fundamental guest service procedures that have been industry hallmarks for nearly 100 years. We know that re-introducing travel requires a serious and committed effort — and we are not alone. The interdependency between hotels, airlines, cruise lines, national and provincial parks, destination attractions, and more means we operate within a web of carefully woven strings. Destinations that lose airline connectivity will inevitably see declines in economic viability as other industries fall by the wayside. Destinations that allow airline arrivals, but have limited, or no operating hotels will see a decline in visitation — and ultimately consumer spending. In non-pandemic times, one in 10 jobs is related to the Canadian tourism industry. Without a thriving travel industry, Canadians cannot return to work, and life, as they desire them.

Article content Albertans this week got a dose of good news with a clear pathway to reopening based on science and targets. With this plan, and as vaccine rollout continues across Canada, dreams of sandy beaches and days without deadlines don’t seem as farfetched as they once did.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content Two weeks ago, I was pleased to join dozens of my association, council and chamber colleagues in sending a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asking the government of Canada to develop, in collaboration with the provinces, “a clear and consistent pan-Canadian approach to reopening our communities, schools and businesses.” In order to realize dreams of sandy beaches and visiting friends and loved ones, the approach must include two things: a national framework for travel and a digital health pass.

This is ever more important when we consider variants that are still emerging, and an unclear picture on how long this virus may remain a problem for humanity. I, for one, think it will be longer than we’d like and may be endemic, much like the seasonal flu.

Article content The first part of the antidote to this situation is a national travel framework. What we have today is a patchwork of regulations within our country, as does the rest of the world toward us. Some places you can travel to freely, some not at all, others only if you are fully vaccinated. Federal leadership is needed to set a broad framework for how travel will work into, out of and within Canada, and then underneath that framework, provinces can address issues depending on their own situation. Alberta’s Open for Summer Plan is demonstrating how vaccinations can be the best form of economic stimulus. When strong vaccine uptake is combined with sensible behaviours and public policy, they offer the promise of a needed boost to the economy through tourism and renewed support of small businesses, which will ultimately lead to increased prosperity for all Albertans.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content Like Alberta’s reopening plan, our national framework should be forward-leaning, based on science and targets. Achieving that requires the second ingredient: digital health passes. Already being employed by the International Air Travel Association with its Travel Pass, many countries across the globe are looking to digital health passes that could be shown to border authorities reporting proof of testing or vaccination. For Canadians, this health pass must be an entirely voluntary undertaking. But if we want to see renewed travel, tourism, live experiences and the resumption of cross-border business, we must accept health passes as one tool to help safely speed our way to that future. The reality is this is happening whether we like it or not, with jurisdictions around the world, and in Canada, already giving differentiated access to vaccinated individuals. Israel, the United Kingdom, the European Union and the United States are all developing forms of certification that can be employed for travel assurances internationally. The only question is whether we’d like to play a lead role in developing or collaborating on a tool or have it imposed on us. Or worse still, be left out of the travel and tourism recovery. At a minimum, our approach should align with the U.S.

Article content Currently, many countries have a two-tier approach to international travel, with requirements for negative testing pre- and post-travel, 10–14-day quarantines on either end depending on the country, and intentionally punitive costs for travellers. Increasingly, many of these countries, like those in Europe, are waiving these requirements for the fully vaccinated. In Canada, Yukon is following suit, offering quarantine-free access to the vaccinated. There’s a big incentive to do this from an economic standpoint too. Economist Tim Quinlan, suggests that 4.5 years’ worth of spending on travel and services could take place in the coming months as restrictions relax, which in turn could help support Canada’s economy if an effective travel framework and health passport system is put into place to capitalize on it. If we don’t take advantage of this new opportunity, we may miss the literal boat.

Article content Understandably, some hesitancies exist around the concept of health passports that span legal, ethical and privacy-related concerns. Beyond this, special attention needs to be paid to racialized and marginalized communities, and individuals who, for medical reasons, cannot get vaccinated. Should those who cannot get vaccinated be unable to travel indefinitely as a result of their ailments? Can, and should, we endorse health exemptions within the travel framework? And most importantly, how do we effectively build trust and rapport with communities with low vaccination intentions due to historical harms? Rather than shying away from these complex questions, it is imperative that we embrace these concerns as areas of importance as Canada moves towards reopening our borders. And address them quickly and directly. Starting with inter-provincial travel, we must first look within, continuing to vaccinate our populations, easing restrictions to reintroduce much-needed group activities and reopening businesses to full capacity. The prize of getting this right is immense. If we can recover employment in our hardest-hit sectors like travel and tourism, Canada could potentially hit employment levels greater than those before the pandemic. For our public health and our economy, it’s the right thing to do. Adam Legge is the president of the Business Council of Alberta.

Article content The question of whether Canada should create COVID-19 vaccine passports was answered by Health Minister Patty Hadju last week, when she confirmed that the federal government will create such a system to allow Canadians to travel internationally again.

Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: It’s no longer a question of whether Canada should have vaccine passports – but how they should be designed Back to video Vaccine passports of one design or another are already in operation in several places around the world, including Israel, Denmark, China, Mexico and Lebanon. The European Union is developing one and so is the UK, and New York has its own system. In these and other places, vaccine passports are helping to bring life back to normal, while facilitating domestic and international travel. For all these benefits, there are good reasons for Canadians to be concerned about the privacy impacts of vaccine passports. History teaches us that measures enacted to respond to emergencies are often “sticky.” Income tax was introduced as a temporary measure during the First World War, yet last week, millions of Canadians filed their annual returns. Correspondingly, privacy campaigners have expressed concerns that a passport system used to check our vaccination status before entering a store or a concert venue during COVID times could form the backbone of a long-lasting system of location-based surveillance. These are legitimate concerns, but our research makes clear that choices can be made in the design characteristics of a vaccine passport system and the rules governing their use to avert them. We can make a vaccine passport that maximizes public health benefits while minimizing privacy and other human rights impacts.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content To do this, several critical questions need to be addressed at the outset. First, who should be permitted to issue vaccination passports? The private sector is taking the lead in many countries and regions. If governments in Canada don’t act, likely the private sector will introduce vaccine passports here too, raising a host of worries relating to equity, discrimination and privacy. If we want access to vaccine passports for all who qualify, governments need to issue passports themselves or regulate the incipient market in vaccine passports. Second, what information should vaccine passports include? Concerns that vaccine passports could be used to track our movements are very real. But to do so, they would need to encode information about our identity — like our name, or a unique identifier, like our Social Insurance Number (SIN). As a matter of principle, vaccine passports should collect as little information about us as possible, possibly not even containing our names. This is known as “data minimization.” Finally, what technological form will the passports take? Most proposals call for digital passports as scannable QR codes or an app on your phone. But digital systems make it easy to collect and store data about the use of vaccine passports, forever. By contrast, paper-based systems could be better at protecting privacy. Flashing a paper-based passport at a security guard does not risk creating the permanent data trail that scanning a digital credential might. Yet it may be possible to develop a digital passport system that leverages the technologies found in contact-tracing apps to help protect our privacy.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content We should also consider who can ask to see your vaccine passport; how vaccine passports will be verified and validated when they are presented to gain access to a place or a service; and what information can be collected and stored whenever a passport holder is required to show it. Good policy can mitigate privacy concerns in each case. For example, governments could mandate that entities that are permitted to inspect the vaccine passport may simply verify the information encoded into the passport without retaining it for any purpose. Vaccine passports will of course be opposed by some on principled grounds. We believe, however, that social justice is best advanced by ending the pandemic and restoring normal life as quickly as possible. If vaccine passports can help to do that, then we should call upon our governments to put systems in place with sufficient safeguards for important values, like privacy.

Article content We have arrived at the one-year anniversary of the first pandemic-related restrictions in Canada. If you had asked most health professionals at that time to predict the status of the pandemic one year later, it’s doubtful that any could have envisioned such an optimistic outlook, given that we had no effective therapies and limited testing and tracing.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content But 12 months later, Canada has four approved, highly efficacious vaccines, the vast majority of individuals living in long-term care facilities have been vaccinated and global efforts are dramatically reducing the burden of COVID-19. With the view looking more hopeful than ever, what can we expect in the next few months? Will life return to normal? We apologize, but this video has failed to load.
tap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: Will life soon return to normal? Back to video For the past year, we have been obsessively watching daily case counts as a guide to the trajectory of the pandemic. While this number was somewhat useful in the pre-vaccine era, as widespread vaccination continues, it will become progressively less informative. The more important metrics to follow are deaths and hospitalizations, both of which will represent a declining proportion of cases as a whole.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content It is better to base policy decisions (such as the lifting of restrictions) on the number of hospitalizations and hospital capacity, rather than just the raw daily case counts. As COVID numbers decrease, the resources invested in mass testing and contact tracing will be able to be redirected to more focused efforts, such as targeted vaccinations, workplace safety and outbreak management. In fact, there will be a time in the not-so-distant future when the publishing of daily case counts will be stopped for good. As the science around vaccines progresses and we get more real-world data about how well they are working, our understanding of the characteristics of each vaccine will evolve, giving public-health experts insight into the optimal timing for second doses and the need for boosters.

Article content As with flu vaccination, different vaccines or different vaccination strategies may have to be considered for the young, elderly and immunocompromised. New focus will be placed on infants and the safest timing in this age group — with the aim of not only protecting children, but also preventing transmission to other vulnerable people in the community. Given the endemicity of COVID-19, this will likely be integrated into our standard childhood vaccinations. One of most significant anticipated changes is the lifting of restrictions on mingling with people outside our households. This move has already been made by the Centres for Disease Control in the United States, which recently announced that individuals who have been vaccinated may congregate with one another. Such recommendations are expected to come to Canada soon, likely slowly and in concert with falling case counts, hospitalizations and deaths. Perhaps as soon as this summer, we will be able to hug loved ones, spend time with each other indoors without masking and even eat indoors at our favourite restaurants.

Article content Canadians should also expect to be able to travel to several countries without the need to quarantine, once a significant proportion of our country has been vaccinated. Universal masking, however, may be here to stay, at least for a time, especially in health-care settings, to limit the spread of respiratory pathogens to vulnerable individuals. Although it would not be mandated, there may be ongoing use of masks in public by the general population as we saw in many Asian countries after the SARS outbreak. What are the changes that will remain in our everyday lives post-COVID? Firstly, the increased social acceptability around not working or going to school while ill, washing hands and generally being more attentive to hygiene for the benefit of others is likely to persist.

Article content Being self-sufficient in the manufacture of personal protective equipment, vaccines and other goods will leave us better prepared if another pandemic ever comes. Investments in health care and long-term care — including a focus on private rooms, stable staffing models, adequate ventilation, infection-control measures and adequate wages for care workers — will help better protect the elderly, whose vulnerability was laid bare during this pandemic. Finally, the pandemic resulted in widespread disruption in many sectors, including health care and education. A backlog of elective surgeries will need to be cleared, access to personalized mental health resources will need to resume and routine preventative medicine will need to be reinforced once again.

Article content Likewise, the immense gap left in children’s learning and socialization will take many months or years to recover from. Many aspects of the economy, including small businesses, have also suffered a massive blow and the aftermath of this is another thing we may be reckoning with for many years to come. Despite all this, there is much to be hopeful for in the months ahead. Vaccines have continued to roll out in full force, and disease burden continues to lessen by the day.

And the federal government’s clumsy Friday announcement has left these travellers scrambling. The new quarantine measures will require travellers entering Canada to take a PCR test upon arrival, and then quarantine in a government contracted hotel for up to three days, at an estimated cost of over $2,000 per person. Once they receive a negative test result, they are required to self-isolate at home for 14 days. Travellers who test positive are taken to a different government facility to quarantine.

Article content I have heard from surgery patients who have travelled to the U.S. at great expense to obtain treatment that is unavailable in Canada, either because it is so specialized or because it has been delayed in Canada. I have heard from the parents of children with severe anaphylaxis who require regular specialized treatment, which is only available at a cutting-edge hospital in California. It is unlikely that a government quarantine facility will adequately meet the needs of individuals recovering from surgery or chemotherapy, or that it can accommodate highly specialized diets. These individuals must be permitted to quarantine at home. But because the government announced the blanket policy without announcing the exclusions, thousands of Canadians are left in a bind. How do you decide what to do when obtaining potentially life-saving therapy for your child requires exposing that child to a potentially life-ending government quarantine facility?

Article content Aside from individuals who travel for their own medical treatment, many other Canadians travel to care for others. For example, I have heard from those who have travelled for funerals of family members, or to care for ailing loved ones. These include individuals in cross border relationships. I heard from a woman who experienced a miscarriage alone in her home while her American fiancé was in the United States. The cost of him coming to comfort her is now an additional $2,000. Cross border relationships are not uncommon, but now come with an enormous and punitive price-tag. It is unclear whether these individuals will be exempt from the government quarantine hotel requirement. It is irresponsible for the government to release this quarantine policy without clarifying the details, especially when the policy has a dramatic impact on our most fundamental freedoms. Canadians have a Charter protected right to enter, remain in, and leave Canada. We have a right to liberty, to move about freely without obstruction. And we have a right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned. We also have a right to equal benefit and protection of the law. The new federal quarantine policy violates all these fundamental rights. Whether these limits to our rights can be justified will depend on the exact details of the order. But while we await those details, remember that while it may feel good to extract some petty vengeance on sun-seekers, the real impact of this policy is hardest on those who can bear it the least.

I lived in the U.S. when Bush was elected president and I know how ravaging some of his policies have been.

Article content The Canada Emergency Response Benefit was put in place to offer financial support to Canadians directly affected by COVID-19. The monthly $2,000 payment was always meant to be a temporary measure. It has since been reduced to $1,200, gross, and certainly isn’t the real culprit of the labour shortage. Already in 2018, a survey from the Business Development Bank of Canada showed that 40 per cent of Canadian SMEs — small-to-medium enterprises — had difficulty filling open positions. It’s a situation the BDC says is here to stay, notably because of Canada’s aging population. This week, a report in La Presse revealed that headhunters were swamped like rarely before , having to fill an increased number of mid- to superior-level positions — positions that pay more than the CERB ever did.

CERB or no CERB, things have changed and so has what employees want. Some who benefitted from the CERB were not intended recipients. There were flaws in the program and there was potential for abuse.

He is the G.O.A.T — the greatest quarterback of all time. He almost wasn’t drafted by the NFL. He was a slow runner, immobile, with a relatively weak arm. So why has he been so successful? He had incredible drive, fitness, self confidence and the ability to understand the game. It was about his determination to succeed, his leadership and execution. He was a winner and knew it, and so did everyone else.

Article content In Ottawa we have another goat, only this time the term is pejorative and implies letting your team down by making the bad play that causes your team to lose at a critical time — the intercepted pass, the fumbled football, the missed kick that turns victory into defeat. The importance of timely vaccine supply Canada has secured the largest number of vaccine doses per person in the world, so why are we so far behind in vaccinations? Ontario will get only a fraction of the promised Pfizer and Moderna vaccine supply in February with no clear delivery schedule in sight. We can’t even determine how many doses we actually are promised. The Pfizer vaccine was initially authorized for five doses per vial; now it’s been decided that it’s six doses per vial. Except that special syringes are needed to squeeze that sixth dose out of the vial, and we don’t have enough yet. Why doesn’t our government fight for us? Trudeau simply says we are on target. What a mess! Winners, after getting punched in the mouth, get up off the floor and pick up their game.

Article content Why can’t we produce our own vaccines? The expensive Montreal facility still under construction will not likely produce much vaccine in 2021. The prime minister had promised the startup of domestic vaccine production in July. But a day later we were told that significant production is unlikely until the very end of the year, or into 2022. The facility won’t be able to make the most effective Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines. Vancouver’s Precision NanoSystems offered to build an mRNA-capable facility last year, but only now has the government decided to invest $25.1 million in the project. Too little, too late yet again. In the meantime, we’re being shamed internationally for choosing to be the only G7 country taking vaccines primarily set aside for poorer nations through COVAX.

Today we continue to inadequately plan for the potential dangers ahead. What will we likely need? Are we content to suffer another losing season? Testing and tracking We continue to lag behind other countries in per capita testing and have an ineffective, underused tracking system. We need mandatory anonymized cellphone tracking and greater testing. Newer, more accurate antigen-based tests for infection are available and will be essential for travel and better workplace protection, especially as more contagious strains dominate.

We need a national database on who was vaccinated when, with what vaccine, and centralized benefit and complication data. This will be even more critical as we will likely need enhanced booster vaccination to better protect against new virus variants in the fall and winter. Canada signed a contract for an IT platform only recently, when this should have been planned and implemented at least six months ago. Again it is late, poor planning. Different vaccines have different rates of protection, especially for the newer variants. We have no announced plans for antibody testing to determine vaccine efficacy even in our high-risk population.

We need leaders who bring intelligent and nimble solutions to restart and grow our economic base. We need leaders who can march our team down the field in the fourth quarter and dare to win and refuse to blandly accept failure. Our future Canada has the opportunity to be the greatest country in the world. We have incredible resources, an intelligent and sensible population, world-class universities and institutions and unlimited space. What we lack is the leadership to excel. We are led by politicians whose primary focus is on winning elections. They lack vision, inspiration, critical thinking and planning. Unless we change we will never live up to our potential, let alone make it to the Super Bowl. Dr. Harry Rakowski is an academic Toronto cardiologist.

Article content The COVID-19 pandemic has often been described as unprecedented, even though, throughout history, we have repeatedly witnessed the spread of pandemic diseases — pathogens we still live with to this day.

Article content Thanks to improved sanitation and cleanliness, early pandemics such as typhoid fever, bubonic plague and cholera are now rare in most parts of the world. On the other hand, relatives of more recent pandemic influenza viruses — such as the Spanish flu of 1918, the Asian flu of 1957, the Hong Kong flu of 1968 and, most recently, the swine flu of 2009 — still exist and circulate each fall and winter.

Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: It's time to learn to live with COVID Back to video Only one human pandemic disease, smallpox, has ever been eradicated. Respiratory viruses like SARS‑CoV‑2 are likely impossible to eradicate because they mutate frequently to evade the immune system, they can reside in animal reservoirs and they are widely distributed around the world. Early on in the pandemic, some countries, such as Australia, tried to implement “COVID-zero” policies, with the aim of keeping out all cases using mandatory hotel quarantines and travel bans. By July 2020, Australia’s deputy chief medical officer declared that eliminating COVID-19 was a “false hope.” Today, half of Australia’s population is back in lockdown as many parts of the world plow ahead with reopening.

Article content Indeed, recent experience with COVID-19 confirms what we know to be true of other viral respiratory pandemics: they settle into the human population with smaller waves over time, eventually causing milder seasonal respiratory illness. The greatest accomplishment of this pandemic has been the development of new vaccines in record time. The fastest any vaccine had previously been developed was four years. In early December 2020, a vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech became the first fully tested immunization to be approved for emergency use. The COVID-19 vaccination program in Canada began in mid-December 2020, with a campaign targeting long-term care (LTC) and retirement home residents and health-care workers.

Article content Vaccination of the elderly was the initial priority, given the high rates of serious illness and death in that population. To date, there have been 25,017 deaths reported in those ages 60 and older in Canada, accounting for 93.9 per cent of COVID-19 related deaths. Fortunately, there has been a high vaccine uptake in those ages 60 and older, with over 90 per cent having received at least one dose and nearly 85 per cent fully vaccinated. This has resulted in a significant decline in severe illness and death among LTC residents since early February, despite high levels of community transmission in the spring. Recent COVID-19 outbreaks occurring in these facilities have resulted in fewer infections and hospitalizations, owing to effective vaccines and natural immunity from earlier infections.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content The COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in Canada have been shown to be successful in large clinical trails and this has been supported by real-world data. While vaccines are highly effective in preventing hospital admission, even against the Delta variant, they are less effective at stopping transmission. When disease elimination is likely impossible, the goal of vaccination becomes a reduction of illness severity. Since COVID-19 vaccines effectively reduce disease severity and death, we can move beyond case counting and instead focus on measures of severe illness such as hospitalizations and death. A natural decoupling of cases from hospitalizations has occurred in highly vaccinated populations such as the United Kingdom, Israel and the United States. With high vaccine coverage among populations at greatest risk of severe disease, continuing to follow case numbers becomes irrelevant over time.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content This has become the case in Canada. Rather than continuing to focus on testing, our resources should be directed toward efforts that focus on vaccinating those at increased risk such as workers in high-risk settings (hospitals, jails, shelters), people with underlying diseases, the elderly and those who are obese. To date, over 80 per cent of eligible Canadians have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and over 70 per cent are fully vaccinated. In Canada, most COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths are now among the unvaccinated. Thus, a more balanced strategy is required to allow us to live with this virus. The high costs of repeated elimination attempts and prolonged societal lockdowns have impacted the economy, livelihoods, businesses and the broader health and well-being of our society. Vulnerable populations, including racialized groups, have faced challenges such as housing and food insecurity and mental health concerns.

Article content Children and youth have also been significantly impacted. The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto has noted an increase in demand for mental health services, including eating disorder admissions, psychiatry admissions and mental health crisis visits. The benefits of elimination attempts have greatly diminished with rising vaccination rates and more effective treatment strategies for COVID-19. Accepting life with COVID-19 will require a shift in thinking. Health is about more than just the coronavirus, and we need to begin to take a broader view of our overall health and well-being. We have largely overlooked causes of preventable death during the pandemic, including overdoses, which have increased dramatically. Modelling has suggested that missed screening and the resulting delays in cancer diagnoses could result in an additional 8,094 cancer deaths in Quebec alone between 2020 and 2025.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content If we accept COVID-19 as an endemic virus, we should not be surprised with small periodic and seasonal rises in hospital admissions and even occasional deaths. It is a usual occurrence for our hospitals to become busy with seasonal respiratory viruses in the fall and winter. Our knee-jerk reaction should no longer be to close large sectors of society, including schools, now that at-risk adults have been vaccinated, or have access to vaccines. We are no longer in an acute crisis thanks to vaccines, natural immunity from earlier infections and improved treatments. We need to recognize that not all measures used to control the spread of COVID-19 earlier in the pandemic are necessary at this time. Good hand hygiene and staying home when sick are practices that should be here to stay. The use of COVID-19 testing where there is a direct impact on patient care, such as in hospital settings, will continue to be important, as will sentinel testing (testing random samples of a population), which has been done for decades.

Article content Otherwise, we need to remember that mitigation measures such as masking and social distancing have not been routinely used to control common seasonal respiratory illnesses. Given what we have achieved with vaccination rates in Canada and the corresponding decrease in hospitalizations and deaths, the risk of overwhelming the health-care system has been reduced and public health management can shift to an endemic approach. According to the World Health Organization, “health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being.” It is time to prioritize the overall health and well-being of our country.

Article content Health Canada’s approval of the first COVID vaccine for children aged five to 11 is wonderful news for the children themselves, their families and for what we are all doing to end the pandemic.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content The vaccine is important; many children have become sick already. Alberta Health reports that almost 21,000 children in the province aged five to nine have become ill with COVID-19. That is a lot of sick children — more than the population of a town. (High River, for example, has about 14,000 residents. ) In Canada, children five to 11 years of age have had more confirmed COVID infection in the fourth wave than any other age group. Worse, 17 children under 18 years in Canada have died . The acceptable number of child and youth deaths from COVID is 0. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: 10 reasons to book a COVID-19 vaccination appointment for your child Back to video Vaccinating your child will help prevent your child from contracting the virus. The vaccine is 90.7 per cent effective in preventing coronavirus infection. Vaccinating your child will prevent them from having severe disease and potentially dying. Since the pandemic began, 44 Alberta children have been admitted to hospital and 15 have been in intensive care. These very sick children require dedicated medical attention to survive very severe COVID-19. Such children can have inflammation of the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain or other organs, or a loss of taste and smell, which can have mental health implications. Children can also develop long-term complications, such as “long COVID,” with symptoms lingering for months. As we learn more about COVID-19 over time, we will know whether having contracted the virus might have fatal complications for people 20 years later, as measles can have .
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content Vaccinating your child means that your child won’t have to quarantine. Alberta Health recommends that an unvaccinated person who comes in contact with a COVID patient at home should stay home for 14 days. This is very disruptive for kids and their households. Vaccinating your child will help other people because vaccinated people rarely infect others. Infected children can accidentally infect their teachers, parents or grandparents. They can accidentally infect immunocompromised people in their lives. Because children five to 11 are now the highest risk group for infection in Alberta. It is inconceivable that they are not now infecting others. We have already imposed a major sacrifice on kids by disrupting school, wearing masks and social distancing to protect the community; vaccination is trivial by comparison.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content Vaccinating your child to protect others is ethical because doing so helps reduce the incidence of disease, helping us “return to normal.” Resumption of normal routine and access to peers will improve child and youth mental health. Dr. Chris Wilkes, a Calgary psychiatrist, has reported a “crisis in terms of a demand on our services that is outstripping our resources.” Vaccinating your child can help reduce the pediatric mental health crisis. Vaccinating your child will help take away one more home for the virus, helping to reduce its ability to live, decreasing the chance of more, perhaps more dangerous, mutations. Vaccinating your child will help your child travel with an older sibling to attend a tournament or competition. No one wants to be the reason that an older sibling can’t attend extracurricular activities.

Vaccinating your child against COVID-19 causes only mild discomfort. Community health nurses are experts at giving the shot with the least discomfort and helping parents put their children at ease Vaccinating your child against COVID-19 is safe. In the United States, the COVID vaccine has already been given to about 2.6 million children ages five to 11, with no more than the same minor side effects seen at other ages. We don’t expect that this age group will see new side effects because, historically, there has never been a new or dramatic difference in side effects when vaccines have been extended to children.

Article content My family and I just visited the United States, spending precious time with loved ones whom we had only seen on screens since the COVID-19 ordeal began. Of the many memories from this trip, two stand out.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content First, there was the shocking disinterest of most people to the ongoing threat of the virus. We saw crowded bars, packed restaurants and almost boastful indifference. I recall in particular three young kids in a boozy lakeside bistro in half-vaccinated Wisconsin, where the hospitals are bracing for new surges. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

In Montreal, as throughout Canada, a range of common-sense rules spreads a protective blanket over our eight- and 11-year-olds. But even here in the land of peace, order and good government, about six million eligible people haven’t been vaccinated. Cases are spiking again in Quebec, where more than a quarter of 18- to 29-year-olds have yet to get a single shot.
Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
Article content Meanwhile, the days are getting shorter, the shadows longer. Next week, the kids will be in school again — and judging by what’s happening in the U.S. , that could mean large numbers of sick children and quite a few very sick ones. At this point, the only solution besides more masking is for every eligible person to get the jab. More vaccinations means fewer vectors, and fewer vectors means less virus in classrooms and cafeterias. Authorities have tried to cajole and convince the holdouts. They are now trying to bribe and browbeat, using the carrot of lotteries and the stick of passports. Still, the vaccination numbers are flat. This is hard for me to accept, but that’s partly because I’m the son of an infectious-diseases specialist. I was eager to get the vaccine.

Plenty of people don’t trust modern science, which has of course delivered its share of horrors. For some Montrealers, it’s hard to get to a vaccination site or to make oneself understood there. Others simply don’t like needles. All of these are understandable reasons to put off the jab. But the clock is nearing midnight. The nightmare approaches: the crowded wards, the rushed intubations, the frantic care for little bodies. Public authorities are out of options, especially after they shut society down last year to protect the elderly. They don’t have the will or the means to do the same thing now for the young.

Article content So there’s only one thing left to say to those who don’t want to get the vaccine: We need you to do it anyway. In my troubled homeland to the south, the willingness to do something against your inclinations was once called virtue. It was the hope for a society cut loose from the restraints of monarchy. And virtue has had a remarkable career in the U.S., inspiring acts of selflessness that give the lie to cheap anti-Americanism. The old dream is clouded today, struggling for breath within a culture whose can-do individualism has decayed into give-me selfishness and outright lunacy. Hence, the unmasked crowds we dodged in Wisconsin. Yet it lives on in little acts of courage. It persists in my vaccine-hesitant relative, who knew that sometimes you have to take one for the team.

Article content In the long run, newspapers get only the freedom of speech protections they deserve. And what they deserve is determined by what they advocate for others in their pages. So we would like to express surprise and alarm at actions reportedly taken on Wednesday by an Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench judge.

Try refreshing your browser, or NP View: An Alberta court's wrongheaded order to compel anti-vaxxers to refute their own opinions Back to video The trio have become the obnoxious leaders of an anti-vaccination movement in Alberta, and had defied court orders by holding large, maskless gatherings at their establishments to preach lucrative, theatrical nonsense. The judge, explicitly wishing to avoid making martyrs of the men, gave them large fines and sentenced them to probation. This is not the problem — indeed, it could be argued that this component of the penalty is too soft. (It might also be pointed out that, to some Canadians, the three are already established martyrs.) There are obvious civil-liberties dimensions to the control of the COVID-19 pandemic by public authorities, but violating a court order during an infectious-disease emergency both invites and deserves punishment.

Article content Yet observers of the hearing noticed that the judge seemed to be dissatisfied with his own leniency, and he unexpectedly waxed creative, issuing an order that the men, in lecturing or preaching from now on, must include a disclaimer stating that their ideas about vaccines are in conflict with the scientific consensus and majority medical opinion. As several charter experts observed after hearing of the decision, this sounds an awful lot like compelled speech, something that Canadian law has correctly treated as equal to the suppression of speech, and is tantamount to the improvised creation of an official scientific credo. Even in commercial settings, our courts are, under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, reluctant to allow authorities to require mandatory public-health messages that bear the imprint of the government. In its 1995 decision in the case of RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada , for example, the Supreme Court struck down a section of the Tobacco Products Control Act compelling “unattributed health warnings,” saying it was “inconsistent with the right of freedom of expression as set out is 2(b) of the charter.” More recently, though it did not relate to public health, there was the successful litigation over the Ontario government’s mandatory gas-pump stickers describing the federal carbon tax.

Article content In this case, orators — and, in the Pawlowskis’ case, preachers of religion — are being required by a court to contradict or refute their own opinions. The charter’s free expression guarantees, Supreme Court Justice Jean Beetz wrote in 1984, “must prohibit compelling anyone to utter opinions that are not his own”; to do otherwise is “totalitarian and as such alien to the tradition of free nations like Canada.” The judge was supposed to be penalizing the defendants for their actions in defiance of law — not their anti-vaccine opinions, which, however mistaken or foolish, are entitled to the most punctilious charter protection. In enforcing a court order, Judge Germain perhaps has more latitude than a government would. But even if his choice of penalty could find some purchase in the law on appeal, it is a gift to the vendors of pseudoscience he was chastising. Among those suspicious of vaccine mandates and the medications themselves, the judge’s action might create the impression that the defendants’ sin was in saying the wrong thing and defying the medical establishment, rather than in making physical headway for deadly pathogens. He may be unwittingly contributing to an ongoing public health disaster in the West. If he thought himself clever for having done this, or deemed himself privately to be striking some sort of heroic blow on behalf of science, we would beseech him to reconsider.

Nik Nanos is the chief data scientist at Nanos Research, a global fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, a research professor at the State University of New York in Buffalo and the official pollster for The Globe and Mail.
Grappling with rising COVID-19 case counts, climbing death rates and anxious citizens, the pandemic has tested the resilience of governments around the world.
The responses of nations have been diverse. China, because of strong central powers, has been able to respond swiftly and enforce public-health directives. Sweden’s response, which had been more about recommendations for behaviour rather than quarantines and curfews, is largely influenced by its constitution and the fact it has no provision for declaring a state of emergency outside wartime. But the country just passed a new pandemic law giving it the same levers as many other countries.
Then there is Canada. The postholiday period has seen a climb to more than 670,000 coronavirus cases and over 17,000 deaths, according the epidemiology update by the Government of Canada. A second wave is in full swing. Provinces are restricting businesses. Vaccines are being procured and the logistics to jab Canadians with doses are in motion.
A look at the arc of public opinion suggests Canadians were generally satisfied with most of their governments in 2020, as federal and provincial leaders stayed focused on the scientific advice of public-health officials. Likewise, the open collaboration among premiers, and between them and the federal government, helped create an environment in which partisanship was seen to take a back seat.
For many Canadians, a key point of comparison is the United States. In contrast to Canada, the messaging from the White House was influenced more by partisanship than by public-health concerns. President Donald Trump openly criticized Democratic governors and the U.S. political environment was characterized more by bickering than collaboration. Even with an imperfect pandemic response, things looked much better in Canada than they did south of the border. This fuelled an attitude of relative satisfaction.
After a lull in the summer months, the proportion of Canadians who say COVID-19 is the top national issue of concern hit a second spike. Worry today, according to Nanos weekly tracking, is about as high as it was last March. Yet feelings of satisfaction remain high even as COVID-19 cases mount. The top emotions noted by Canadians include “satisfaction” (33 per cent), followed by “optimism” (18 per cent), “pessimism” (18 per cent), “anger” (15 per cent) and “disinterest” (8 per cent).

A newly released 14-year tracking study on the federation by Nanos suggests that even though people may not be outright happy, they are giving increasingly positive assessments of the nation. After four years of declining scores on the relations between the federal and provincial governments, 2020 showed a significant jump. In 2019, a measly 12 per cent of respondents said relations had improved or somewhat improved. Fast forward to the 2020 evaluation and this increased to 40 per cent, the third-highest score in 14 years.
Asked whether Canada is moving in the right or wrong direction, the proportion who said the country was moving in the right direction jumped from 41 per cent to 58 per cent over the past year – among the highest scores in more than a decade. Forty-seven per cent said the Trudeau Liberal government was doing a very good or somewhat good job (up from 27 per cent in 2019), while 31 per cent said the government was doing a very poor or somewhat poor job (down from 44 per cent in 2019). The positive evaluation was the second highest since tracking began in 2007.
Scores on Canada’s international reputation remain below average for the tracking study. Thirty-six per cent say our reputation has improved or somewhat improved (up from 22 per cent in 2019), 26 per cent say it has not improved or somewhat not improved (down from 43 per cent in 2019) while more than three in 10 (36 per cent) say the change is neutral.

The twist in the data is that, even with the COVID-19 infections and deaths, a second spike and our economy effectively on ice as many businesses cope with the pandemic, Canadians felt comparatively better in 2020 than 2019.
The federation’s pandemic response should be considered imperfect because we can never fight back the virus too quickly, help enough businesses survive or protect our at-risk populations enough. Imperfect is not bad, but it is an acknowledgement that we can do better as a nation.
The upshot is that, even with the imperfections, Canadians felt better about the state of our federation in 2020 than in 2019.
The imperfect response to the pandemic has also put a spotlight on the resilience of the federation – the ability of our politicians to set aside political gain for the public good, spurred by a common sense of purpose.
Last year may be a political walk in the park compared with what lies ahead. The real stress test of the federation will occur over the next 12 months.
First, the cost to fight the pandemic and keep Canadians economically above water will begin to mount. Although there is federal fiscal capacity, idling swaths of the economy such as the restaurant, hospitality and bricks-and-mortar retail sectors will not bode well for job prospects or the health of small and medium-sized enterprises.
Second, the true unemployment rate and job disruption has been masked by government stimulus. In most recessions, unemployment is a lagging indicator. This means fallout of the labour market disruption that began last year may have a long tail rolling into late 2021 and 2022.
Third, news of virus variants is a curveball for public-health officials and creates uncertainty in the battle against COVID-19.
Finally, the promise and hope of vaccines to help transition to a new normal has buoyed optimism. One possible interpretation of current trends is that we are in a public opinion “vaccine halo.” This will be the year of the vaccine and people can put the pandemic behind them.
That is an optimistic view of the situation. A more pessimistic view is that the logistics of vaccinating Canadians will be complicated and perhaps it will take longer than anticipated to hit the herd immunity public-health officials are striving to reach.
2020 proved that even in the imperfect world, our federation remained resilient. The real test may be 2021 – whether we fight back the pandemic or become mired in a longer-term economic and public-health war of deadly attrition.
Note on the data
Nanos conducted an RDD dual frame (land- and cell-lines) hybrid telephone and online random survey of 1,048 Canadians, 18 years of age or older, between Dec. 27 and Dec. 30, 2020, as part of an omnibus survey.

Article content Here in Saskatchewan we have reached a grim milestone: The province now leads the country in case rates, while doctors continue to warn acute care systems are being pushed to the limit. Yet, Health Minister Paul Merriman and Premier Scott Moe still keep our current COVID-19 course . While restrictions were greatly loosened back in July, the present state of COVID-19 in the province has changed since the early summer. It is time to recognize this pandemic reality.

Article content Let’s be clear: Vulnerable people are dying from COVID-19, and will continue to die unless we act now. Throughout the waves of the pandemic, we have been told that reasonable people would and should listen to public health officials and government public health orders. Wearing a mask, staying socially distant, and getting a vaccine are our best tools to tackle the pandemic. Unfortunately, the silence of the Moe government on these measures speaks volumes. It appears that the Moe government has washed its hands, so to speak, of the pandemic, informing the province that we are now in the time of “living with COVID” ( there’s even a webpage on the government website dedicated to this fallacious message of personal responsibility ). Is this the message we should be sending to those vulnerable people in our communities who are more likely to die from the virus? This injustice cannot stand. Collective, community responsibility to one another’s health and safety will keep our communities healthy and safe overall. Not only do we owe ourselves the chance to get vaccinated, but we owe our neighbours, friends and other community members (whether we know them or not) to get vaccinated too.

Where is the tipping point that will allow the Moe government to reinstitute mandatory indoor mask usage ? How many preventable deaths from COVID-19 will the Moe government allow before action is taken? The overwhelming evidence suggests that COVID-19 measures work, and complicit ignorance of scientific evidence does not; the Moe government must face this truth.

Article content The ongoing ignorance and denial quietly (or not so quietly) ushers us toward further peril, suffering and loss. Ignorance and denial are not a diet solely for the “uneducated.” Its leading proponents are often well educated, peddling to their own political advantage. This ignorance produces doublespeak, half-truths and lies used to justify policies and actions which are in opposition to moral values, integrity and outright decency. Do we stand on the edge of a disastrous cliff, staring into a pandemic abyss in the province? There are many who argue that we do. We are confronted with the catastrophic impacts of weak policymaking and a lack of leadership under the Moe government. We are witnessing a near sociopathic lack of interest in — or compassion and responsibility for — others. As some politicians from across the political spectrum and community leaders across the country continue to promote and introduce vaccine and masking mandates, the coldness and indifference of the Moe government proliferates. It is because of the escalating production and the seeming ubiquity of ignorance that the deepening political, cultural and social coldness from the Moe government will freeze our province in its tracks of getting out of the pandemic. Now is not the time for blatant lies, half-truths, evasions, legalistic sophistries and ideological appeals. Now is the time for clear policy, mandatory mask and vaccine mandates, and leadership from the Moe government. We have come too far in this pandemic to let ignorance and denial win.

Existing systemic inequalities pre-pandemic have been further exacerbated by recent shut-down measures, resulting in what some economists are calling a “she-cession,” as more women have lost their jobs and fewer women than men are re-gaining employment. What is clear is this: we will not achieve our full economic potential if support for women is not centred in our planning. Every day, women entrepreneurs actively contribute to the Canadian economy. Women lead 50% of all new businesses in Canada as well as partially or wholly own 47% of all small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME). Businesses led by women create more jobs and have a higher chance of survival even though they generally tend to be smaller than businesses led by men.

Women-owned businesses tend to be smaller, with fewer employees, and are less likely to be incorporated. Unfortunately, most government support programs during the pandemic favour SMEs with employees. Many of the programs are designed for SME owners with payroll and although eligibility was recently expanded in the loan program to address this issue, many self-employed Canadians still may not meet the requirements. The thresholds for many of these programs do not accommodate women, leaving them no options but to find other means of supporting themselves, their workers, and their businesses. As for women workers, the realities of the pandemic are even harsher. Women are more likely to work in retail and service roles at the frontlines of COVID-19 support (from personal support workers to grocery clerks). Women also bear the brunt of unpaid work, including childcare, household duties, and elder care – all of which have become more challenging during the crisis.

These challenges are particularly acute for Black, Indigenous and racialized women, women who live in rural communities, senior women, immigrant women, and women with disabilities – all of whom may be experiencing disruptions to their regular lines of care and support. As we look at the path to economic recovery, we must continue to improve the alignment between public policy and economic outcomes. Breaking down barriers women face during the pandemic will lead to new economic activity and growth: more women entrepreneurs mean more wealth generation, more women in the skilled trades mean more opportunities to build, and more women in decision-making roles mean more inclusive outcomes.

Article content Trudeau announced two measures to help workers. The first is the waiving of the mandatory one-week waiting period on Employment Insurance (EI) claims to allow quarantined, and self-isolated, individuals to receive pay in the first week of their claim. The second is the extension of the work-sharing program to provide compensation to employers struggling to support employee incomes for up to 76 weeks.

Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: COVID-19 and workers in the gig economy Back to video Unfortunately, many, if not most, gig workers do not have access to federal benefits, so reducing the wait time for EI claims is of no value to them. Similarly, Canada’s Work-Sharing Program is “designed to help employers and employees avoid layoffs when there is a temporary reduction in the normal level of business activity that is beyond the control of the employer.” Though COVID-19 is certainly beyond employers’ control, the Work-Sharing Program is irrelevant to gig workers who are classified as independent contractors. Given the legal battles launched by gig-economy heavyweights like Uber to fight the designation of independent contractors as employees, gig organizations are unlikely to be interested in the Work-Sharing Program, considering the precedent this may set.

Article content In short, the government’s plan leaves a significant portion of Canada’s most vulnerable population in the lurch. Federal Labour Minister Filomena Tassi comment that she has “ not been overwhelmed with people that are saying, ‘We don’t want to go to work and we feel compelled to go to work ” underscores the government’s lack of understanding of many gig workers’ situations. The vast majority of gig-economy platforms focus on low- to medium-skilled work, and gig workers on these platforms have little bargaining power as compared to workers performing high-skill work on platforms like UpWork. Many low-skilled gig workers put in more than 40 hours a week and/or are dependent on the platform as their sole income source, while others work more than one job. They can’t take a day off work, let alone 14 days, should they fall ill.

Article content Though Uber and Lyft have announced that they will begin offering drivers up to 14 days of paid sick leave if they contract COVID-19, or are quarantined, it’s unclear how these companies will assess claims and determine drivers’ compensations. Given the unsustainable economics of the ride-hailing industry, whether (and to what extent) Uber and Lyft keep their promises remains to be seen. Nevertheless, the fact that Uber has offered sick leave is interesting insofar as the gesture suggests that drivers are indeed part of its core business ( something the company has long argued against ). The Canadian government should consider this pandemic a wake-up call. Labour policies must be updated for the gig economy and to protect vulnerable workers. Fortunately, the government may find that reinventing the wheel is unnecessary, specifically for low-skilled gig workers.
