OPINION: It's time to follow the scientific method -- and re-evaluate Canada's COVID approach,https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-its-time-to-follow-the-scientific-method-and-re-evaluate-canadas-covid-approach,torontosun.com,"By: Claus Rinner, Donald G. Welsh, Jan Vrbik, John Zwaagstra, Laurent Leduc and Valentina Capurri",['Special To Toronto Sun'],2021-06-06 00:00:00,"Photo by Luke Hendry / Luke Hendry By: Claus Rinner, Donald G. Welsh, Jan Vrbik, John Zwaagstra, Laurent Leduc and Valentina Capurri Did you know that the average age of Canada's COVID-19 deaths in 2020 was almost 84 years, while the average age at death in Canada in 2019 was only 76.5 years? You would think that these Statistics Canada data published on June 1 would give politicians, public health officials, and the media reason to re-examine the threat of SARS-CoV-2 and consider age-specific response measures. An extraordinary burden is put on children, youths, and young families, who are at virtually no risk from the virus nor contribute significantly to its transmission. And blanket emergency orders are being extended for the nth time, although they have been only marginally effective over the last 15 months. We are a group of academics with PhDs spanning the natural and social sciences as well as the humanities. What we have in common is a daily practice of critical thinking and following the scientific method. Science continuously questions previous findings, explores new approaches, and validates or refutes them with evidence. As scientists and scholars, we categorically reject the notion that ""the science is settled"". Science never settles. What we know about COVID-19 has changed over the last 15 months. For example, did you know that asymptomatic transmission is no longer considered relevant for SARS-CoV-2 spread? Yet, why are the implications of the updated science on mask mandates and social distancing not being discussed? How could one-half of the United States go safely back to the old normal with no mask mandates, distancing rules, or vaccine requirements, while the province of Ontario maintains one of the tightest restrictions of civil liberties in the world? Why are dissenting doctors silenced by their professional organizations and the media, instead of being listened to and cross-examined? In early 2020, asymptomatic transmission was suspected to pose a risk large enough to respond to the novel coronavirus with unprecedented lockdowns and mobility restrictions. Normally, any important government policy is subject to a cost-benefit analysis – why was this not done for the COVID-19 measures? Independent Canadian researchers predict a devastating toll: one study estimates that 5-10 times more life is lost due to lockdowns (measured in years of life lost prematurely, i.e. Canadians dying earlier than they would without lockdowns), as compared to any lives that may have been saved, and another study pegs the costs at up to 282 times greater than the benefits. The collateral damage of lockdowns on our emotional, physical, and mental health is increasingly coming to light. And so is the impact of mobility restrictions on the fabric of society: for more than one year, we have been encouraged to refrain from regular social contact and to perceive those around us as carriers of disease and death. Considering that humans are social beings, this is an unprecedented experiment that might have devastating long-term effects, especially on children. The United States has been a political battlefield for different approaches to responding to COVID-19. Consider California versus Florida. California imposed full dining closures and stay-at-home mandates in November-December 2020, whereas Florida had lifted most restrictions as early as September 2020. Despite California's strict measures, the daily death counts attributed to COVID19 continued to rise during the third wave and peaked in January-February 2021. A similar rise was seen in Florida but the peak level was lower than for California, followed by a steady decrease. Florida has done remarkably well, health-wise and economically, throughout the pandemic and that with a population more than half that of Canada squeezed into a landmass similar to Nova Scotia. It does not take a degree in medicine or public health to see the possibility that the threat of SARS- CoV-2 was greatly exaggerated and the Western world's pandemic response badly mismanaged. It is extremely dangerous to suppress diverging analyses and censor opposing views, as has been happening with respect to COVID-19 in mainstream and social media, in the public sphere and at the workplace, and even in our universities and parliaments. If we do not maintain careful checks and balances on government and public health officials, we run the risk of taking the wrong path for too long. This is the situation we are facing right now, and it is imperative that we stop and retrace our steps to find a sensible, sustainable way to deal with SARS- CoV-2, as we do with other endemic viruses. This country has to fully re-open and get back to normal life, along with restoring long-established pandemic preparedness.

Guest Opinion: Trudeau and Biden peddling climate change alarmism,https://calgarysun.com/opinion/letters/guest-opinion-trudeau-and-biden-peddling-climate-change-alarmism,calgarysun.com,"Climate alarmism, or at least the desire to appease alarmists for political benefit, fuels much of the federal regulatory agenda in both Canada and the United…",['Matthew Lau'],2021-02-12 00:00:00,"Photo by Wayne Cuddington / Postmedia Climate alarmism, or at least the desire to appease alarmists for political benefit, fuels much of the federal regulatory agenda in both Canada and the United States. There are, as American examples, President Joe Biden cancelling federal permits for the Keystone XL pipeline and the goings-on this year at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission where the chairman (appointed by Biden) made climate disclosures a top priority. Mandating climate disclosures is premised on the idea that financial markets fail to properly account for climate change risks; thus, the government should force companies to disclose such risks and how they plan to mitigate them. This idea, however, that private investors need advice from the federal government on how to invest and what they should demand companies disclose, is dubious to say the least. Nevertheless, in Canada too, the federal government has shown significant enthusiasm for mandating climate disclosures. Last year, a loan program to help large employers survive the COVID lockdowns required recipient companies ""to publish annual climate-related financial disclosure reports, including how their future operations will support environmental sustainability and national climate goals."" With the more than $100 billion expropriated from Canadian taxpayers to fund federal climate spending since 2015 apparently insufficient, the Trudeau government is bent on conscripting private capital through regulation as well to bolster its ammunition in the climate wars. The goal, it should be clear, has nothing to do with improving financial markets and everything to do with raising public alarm about climate change. Indeed, if the goal is to improve investment decisions through corporate risk disclosure mandates, it's odd that Ottawa would elevate climate change above any number of greater risks — the possibilities of world war, riots and political unrest, cyberattacks, epidemics and so on. We could also add to the list of risks greater than climate change itself, the risk of activist politicians imposing economically destructive policies to deal with climate change. Both Joe Biden and Justin Trudeau are committed to emissions targets with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C, but as economists Robert P. Murphy and Ross McKitrick reported in a recent Fraser Institute paper, this goal comes with significant economic costs and ""did not arise from the economics literature or from formal cost-benefit analysis."" The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) admitted in its 2018 report, Murphy and McKitrick note, that policies for achieving the 1.5C target would only be justified if the environmental damages of carbon emissions in 2030 ranges from $135 to $5,500 per tonne — or about two to 89 times what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated earlier this year. Murphy and McKitrick also cited the work of economist William Nordhaus, who was awarded the Nobel prize for his work analyzing the long-term economic effects of climate change and climate policies. According to Nordhaus's 2016 modelling work, achieving the 1.5C target would probably be so economically destructive that people would be better off if governments did nothing about climate change. If governments are really convinced that companies should be forced to make disclosures on the financial risks of climate change, it would make more sense to have the companies disclose how they plan to deal with the risks posed by economically destructive federal climate policies than the risks posed by climate change itself. The former, after all, is likely a greater financial risk to most companies than the latter. Matthew Lau is an adjunct scholar with the Fraser Institute.

Opinion: The conservative path to a fairer country,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-the-conservative-path-to-a-fairer-country,nationalpost.com,"Ako Ufodike and William Luke: Sound conservative values, such as fiscal responsibility, an economy that works for all, fairness, opportunity, self-reliance,…","['Ako Ufodike', 'William Luke', 'Special To National Post']",2020-06-06 00:00:00,"Ako Ufodike and William Luke: Sound conservative values, such as fiscal responsibility, an economy that works for all, fairness, opportunity, self-reliance, respect for the rule of law and personal freedom are essential if we hope to level the socioeconomic playing field Photo by Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press In the midst of a global pandemic, many around the world have been deeply disturbed by the alleged murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in broad daylight. Even more shocking was the fact that three of his fellow officers actively participated. Second-degree murder charges have been laid against the officer who pressed his knee on Floyd's neck, and the others have now been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. The debate that has ensued in Canada in the aftermath has been mixed, with some acknowledging that racism exists in Canada, and others outright denying it. The reality is that Canada, much like the United States, has a history of social injustice and economic inequality between different racial groups. This goes as far back as the first contact between Europeans and Indigenous peoples. Over the centuries, the economic and political imbalances between communities have been redefined with each new wave of immigration, as evidenced by the fact that we scrapped and denounced the head tax, only to impose another variant of it — a now normalized right of landing fee. Racism towards various minority groups exists in Canada still, and anti-black racism is a real problem and is certainly a cause of frustration, but we believe that there is hope. Through solid political and civic engagement with our democratic institutions, social and economic justice can be achieved. Canadian values and, in particular, true conservative principles, have and will continue to shape a fairer and more inclusive Canada. An essential first step is to recognize and admit that there are social and economic challenges to overcome. Photo by JEAN LEVAC/Postmedia Take the current COVID-19 crisis, for example. Data shows that visible minority groups in Canada have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic and the economic fallout resulting from the tough social-distancing measures that have been put in place. This is coming on top of endemic economic and health crises in these communities, yet Canada still refuses to collect ethnicity-related health and mortality data, in contrast to many other OECD countries, including the U.S. According to Statistics Canada, approximately one in four Canadians could become financially vulnerable due to work interruptions and economic lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This is particularly concerning for visible minority groups. The Ontario Anti-Racism Directorate's 2017 community consultations found that black-Canadians face major obstacles when looking for employment. Even though the black community has achieved much success in many sectors, systemic discrimination puts a significant section of the community at risk. This is especially true during periods of great economic uncertainty, such as we find ourselves in today. Marginalized communities are negatively impacted in many other ways, as well, including: over-representation in the criminal justice system; lower levels of educational attainment; poorer health and quality of life; restricted access to capital and less property ownership. These outcomes reinforce systemic barriers. The Association of Black Conservatives (ABC) actively promotes civic engagement and political participation because these are the proven pathways towards reform. It is only through active engagement in democratic politics at all levels — municipal, provincial and federal — that real and lasting systemic change can be achieved. Photo by Carlos Osorio/Reuters Moreover, it is critical that all communities, particularly disadvantaged communities, engage with all political parties and not just left-leaning parties that act as though they are entitled to the visible minority vote. It is essential that marginalized communities are not just in the room, but are also in decision-making positions. This is not about quotas; it is about diversity. Canada needs to come to terms with the fact that our standards regarding diversity and equity fails to meet acceptable standards in 2020. Sound conservative values, such as fiscal responsibility, an economy that works for all, fairness, opportunity, self-reliance, respect for the rule of law and personal freedom are essential if we hope to level the socioeconomic playing field and allow communities and individuals to thrive. Economic inequality and social injustice are enduring problems that require sound policies and political commitment. ABC believes in advancing the principles of equity and inclusion for the black-Canadian community and all Canadians. As we look to build a better and stronger country after COVID-19, persistent socioeconomic inequalities in visible minority groups can no longer be overlooked. The True North is stronger and freer when individuals can reach their full potential. We are, after all, our brothers' and sisters' keepers.

OPINION: No need for lockdown in northwest,https://www.thegraphicleader.com/opinion/editorials/opinion-no-need-for-lockdown-in-northwest,www.thegraphicleader.com,"It’s been said not to fix things that aren’t broken and the northwest’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic is not broken, so why do we need Queen’s Park to…",['Ryan Stelter'],2020-12-12 00:00:00,"Photo by Wayne Marcino It's been said not to fix things that aren't broken and the northwest's response to the COVID-19 pandemic is not broken, so why do we need Queen's Park to swoop in and tell us to sit inside for two weeks? The people of northwestern Ontario are getting an extra-special Christmas present from the province this year — a 14-day lockdown. The lockdown puts the Northwestern Health Unit, among the other health units in northern Ontario, into the grey zone for two weeks starting on Boxing Day. Media reports over the weekend said the lockdown was to start on Dec. 24, but apparently the dire situation Ontario is in can wait five days. We have it better up here than our southern Ontario counterparts, who will enter into a 28-day lockdown. This seems like a good idea in the south where case numbers are rising and hospitals are reaching capacity. Although, Dr. Adalsteinn Brown, a member of the premier's COVID-19 table, said on Monday that any lockdown less than four weeks isn't effective. So what is a two-week lockdown going to do exactly? What we've been doing to prevent the spread of COVID-19 has worked thus far in the northwest. We've followed the public health advice, we've washed our hands, we've stayed home when we're sick and we've worn masks in enclosed public spaces. Why are we being punished for what is going down south? Now, health officials have said that the Christmas holidays could bring more cases as people will gather in their homes, even if they shouldn't. But how is that any different than Thanksgiving, or Halloween, or Canada Day? We never saw a significant spike in the northwest after those holidays. Sure, there was a small spike after Thanksgiving, but it wasn't bad and our hospitals weren't overrun. We did move into the ""Yellow"" zone under the province's pandemic response framework in November, but our case counts have plummeted since then. A move to ""Green"" should've been on the cards, but instead, we are being shoved into our homes and business owners will have to shelf their Boxing Day sales as curbside pickup will be the only option to collect revenue. The ironic thing is, under the current restrictions, you can have a gathering of 10 people in your home, so Christmas is not even close to being cancelled. In fact, it's being enabled. But Boxing Day shopping? Not allowed. Are you scratching your head, too? January tends to be a slower month as people are recovering from the holiday hangover, and the end of December is an opportunity for retailers to cash in on people's padded Christmas wallets. The province is offering a grant to businesses, but how much will that help? To boot, ski hills are not allowed to open so Mount Evergreen won't be able to operate when kids are out of school. Premier Doug Ford said during his daily press conference on Dec. 21 that he knows what it's like to be a business owner. But does he know what it's like to be a northerner? Queen's Park needs to stop forgetting there are people who live, work and play up here in the northwest. Somehow being located next to Winnipeg, one of Canada's COVID-19 hotspots, we've kept our case counts low. Will this lockdown in the northwest send people to Winnipeg to shop? Who knows, the lockdowns in Manitoba certainly brought Manitobans here, it hasn't been an uncommon sight to see Manitoban plates roaming Kenora. It is still not cool to demonize Manitobans, by the way. Should they be here? Probably not, but you shouldn't be in Manitoba unless absolutely necessary. It's a two-way street. Ontario could also extend this lockdown, as they've introduced legislation to enable themselves to do that. So who knows how long it will last? Alas, we must deal with the cards we're dealt, so it's into isolation we go on Boxing Day. The silver lining is we live in the most beautiful part of the world to social distance outside. Take the time to go ice fishing, fire up the woodstove at camp, go for a hike or support a local restaurant and have a takeout movie night. These two weeks will hopefully fly by and we can get back to where we were before."
Opinion: Pandemic's impact on mental health might surprise us,https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/opinion-pandemics-impact-on-mental-health-might-surprise-us,montrealgazette.com,"To be sure, there have been serious effects for some, but apocalyptic visions of a looming mental health crisis may be erroneously alarmist.",['Rob Whitley'],2020-08-08 00:00:00,"To be sure, there have been serious effects for some, but apocalyptic visions of a looming mental health crisis may be erroneously alarmist. Photo by John Mahoney / Montreal Gazette The last months have been filled with bleak predictions about mental health in Canada due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These predictions have been couched in apocalyptic language, with much talk of a looming ""mental health crisis,"" ""depression time-bomb"" or even an ""epidemic of suicide."" Such forecasts predict an imminent mental health disaster across Canada, with worse consequences than the coronavirus pandemic itself. But are such dystopian visions based on scientific evidence, or sensational scaremongering? A just released Léger survey of more than 1,500 adult Canadians give some preliminary answers. This survey found that only 16 per cent of Canadians rate their mental health as ""bad"" or ""very bad"" since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. In other words, the vast majority rate their mental health as ""good,"" ""very good"" or ""excellent,""despite rising concerns about a second wave and further lockdowns. These findings are consistent with pre-existing research indicating that socio-economic crises can (counter-intuitively) actually promote mental health. For example, the phrase ""Blitz spirit"" is well-known in the United Kingdom, referring to a semi-mythical period of the Second World War, where Londoners rallied together with resolution and defiance to resist the ravages of nightly Luftwaffe air-raids. This ""Blitz spirit"" is epitomized in a famous British wartime poster Keep Calm and Carry On. While some have questioned the reality of the ""Blitz spirit,"" research shows that psychiatric admissions actually decreased during the Blitz. Moreover, a network of psychiatric clinics that were set up to cater for the expected mental health casualties of the Blitz were closed due to a lack of patients, indicating that the Luftwaffe raids did not trigger an epidemic of mental illness. More recently, a large-scale European study surprisingly found an overall decrease in depressive symptoms after the Global Financial Crisis across 19 of the 21 countries studied (Spain and Cyprus being the exceptions). These findings imply that the repercussions of the Global Financial Crisis were not uniformly negative, and that doomsday predictions about an impending mental health crisis due to COVID-19 may not be warranted. These findings raise the question: What factors promote mental health during a socio-economic crisis such as COVID-19? The existing research points to some surprising answers. First, work is a source of purpose and meaning for most people, but can also engender significant amounts of stress. The ""work from home"" directives associated with COVID-19 will have provided a welcome break from a stressful work environment for many, as well as less time commuting and more quality time with immediate family, all of which has been linked to positive mental health. Second, research indicates that people tend to cut back on unhealthy habits such as smoking, drinking and junk food during socio-economic crises, often as a cost-cutting measure. Contrariwise, people are more likely to exercise outdoors and obtain adequate sleep due to reduced traffic, which can also mean less pollution and fewer accidents. All this can improve physical health, which is inextricably linked to mental health. Third, crises such as COVID-19 can engender their own type of ""Blitz spirit,"" uniting people in a collective experience and common cause. Indeed, a Hong Kong study found that the SARS crisis engendered widespread increases in social support from family and friends, as well as increased attention to mental health issues per se across society. To be sure, COVID-19 has created considerable anxiety and insecurity across Canada, and support and resources should be available for those in need. But apocalyptic visions of a looming mental health crisis may be erroneously alarmist. For some, the ongoing crisis will cause mental health woes, particularly the newly unemployed and those in financial difficulties. But for others, it may provide a much-needed breathing space and an opportunity to rethink priorities.

"Economic Underperformance, Excessive Indebtedness, and Our Constrained Future",https://www.macvw.ca/research/2020/9/9/economic-underperformance-excessive-indebtedness-and-our-constrained-future,www.macvw.ca,,['Kari Lancaster'],2020-07-25 12:46:00,"With last week's federal deficit announcement, it is now more important than ever that we acknowledge our current realities with detail and clarity. We otherwise will be unable to develop a believable and effective path forward in the post-COVID world. The problem is that our current realities are uncomfortably negative. Many of us just don't want to see this or believe it. We were in a slow-moving crisis of competitiveness, investment, and productivity prior to the COVID lockdown. Now, we have both stagnant productivity and excessive levels of debt. This feels negative as most of us understandably want to feel positive and optimistic about our future. However, for optimism to be real it must be grounded in reality. It is only then we can develop a believable and inspiring vision, and the appropriate strategies to recover and rebuild our economy. Prior to the COVID lockdown, the economic fundamentals in Canada were already grim: As a Canadian, if you were fortunate enough to accumulate savings, the last thing you should have done is to invest in Canadian companies on Canadian stock exchanges. We were in a state of investment, competitive, and economic underperformance before the pandemic-related collapse. ""Going back to normal"" or ""the way things were"" is going back to a set of conditions that were compromising the future for all Canadians. And now, we have the added reality of excessive debt. The inevitable consequence is a loss of financial flexibility, less capacity to spend, and more financial risk in the event of an extended recession, additional intermittent lockdowns, or some other new, unforeseen crisis. Although the financial position of our federal government was reasonable going into the COVID lockdown (debt to GDP ratio was 35%), this has all changed seemingly overnight. With a $350 billion deficit, we are now adding about 15% to the debt to GDP ratio. Maybe this still doesn't look too alarming, however, we are missing a large part of the picture if we ignore the provinces. We have learned in crisis that the national government will be called upon to backstop the credit demands of all provinces, and to a certain extent, even corporate and household debt. Ontario's debt is now about $400 billion, Quebec $200 billion, and then there are the other provinces. The Western provinces, including Manitoba, are now close to approximately $150 billion. The Atlantic provinces represent another $50 billion in debt. If you're keeping track, that's $800 billion of provincial debt combined with now over $1 trillion of federal debt. Total ""all in"" government debt is now at least $1.8 trillion and heading towards $2.0 trillion which would be 100% of GDP – that represents over $50,000 for every man woman and child in Canada, or $200,000 for a household of four. Analysts and economists tend to look at debt solely on the basis of decision-making authority and responsibility at the entity level, as this is where insolvency would occur. This is why most don't aggregate debt. But aside from insolvency risk, the key problem with debt that's often overlooked is how it constrains choice and optionality. The aggregation of choice and commitment drives our overall economy. Understanding our economic outlook requires accounting for the burden of debt across all decision-making entities. The government debt described above is layered on top of consumer and corporate debt. Total consumer debt in Canada is at a record $2.3 trillion which includes $1.6 trillion of mortgages. Household debt to disposable income is now at a record high of 181%. Corporate debt in Canada is also at record levels of about $2.4 trillion and based on the Bank of International Settlements, our corporate debt service ratio is among the highest in the world. Total household, corporate, and government debt is about $7.0 trillion. This is 350% on a $2 trillion economy. The one thing we know about debt is that if you can survive through a downturn, it will constrain choice; it will constrain the scope and flexibility of decision-making commitments. This will be the new reality for many decision makers across the entire economy. You can reasonably expect that consumers and corporations will be spending less and repairing balance sheets, and governments at all levels will be forced to be more accountable and discerning in spending and borrowing. All of this will likely be a net drag on the economy for years. Unfortunately, this is all happening at the same time that Canada's GDP per capita and labour productivity have been lagging. The issue of productivity must be emphasized. To quote Nobel Laureate economist, Paul Krugman: ""Productivity isn't everything, but in the long run it is almost everything. A country's ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise output per worker."" Canada is now in an era of both stagnating productivity, low competitiveness, and excessive levels of indebtedness. In the corporate investment world, we often describe this as a ""strategic straightjacket"" – with less choice and less freedom to move. All of this should encourage a reset in priorities towards fiscal constraint, incentivizing investment, and pursuing more business-friendly policies and strategies that will tilt towards increasing innovation, productivity, and prosperity."
Opinion: Why we’re not doing better on COVID vaccines,https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-why-were-not-doing-better-on-covid-vaccines,financialpost.com,Liberal government pharmaceutical policy has failed Canadians at our time of greatest need,"['Paul Lucas', 'Special To Financial Post']",2021-01-14 00:00:00,"Opinion: Why we're not doing better on COVID vaccines Opinion: Why we're not doing better on COVID vaccines Liberal government pharmaceutical policy has failed Canadians at our time of greatest need Photo by Arnold Jerocki/Getty Images As the CEO of GlaxoSmithKline Canada (GSK) for 16 years, now retired for nine, I was deeply involved in the production and distribution of the Canadian vaccine for the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, working collaboratively with public health and other government officials. All the vaccine for that pandemic was produced in the GSK factory in Quebec City. The campaign, after a few initial snags, was a tremendous success. The vaccine was developed, rolled out and injected into millions of Canadians in just several months. I felt compelled to write about the current vaccine supply situation when federal Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs Dominic Leblanc erroneously stated on CTV's Power Play that we don't have any domestic vaccine production in Canada because ""GSK closed its facility during the Harper years."" In fact, that facility is still operational and manufactures much of Canada's annual flu vaccine. Opinion: Why we're not doing better on COVID vaccines As of this writing Canada ranks tenth in the world in COVID vaccine doses administered per 100 population. This is surprising considering Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has consistently stated that ""We are better on vaccines than just about every other country."" The provinces have worked out their logistics issues and are not the problem. The problem is clearly that the federal government is not able to procure significant doses of vaccine until April. Canada will receive 1.2 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccine by the end of January and six million doses by the end of March. That will allow the vaccination of approximately three million citizens — less than 10 per cent of the population. Many other countries have received significantly more vaccine on a population-adjusted basis. The question is: Why is Canada not able to acquire more vaccine early? Not surprisingly, the industry has gone elsewhere to invest — to places like the U.K., the U.S. and the EU where that positive environment does exist. They are all performing better than Canada on early vaccine acquisition. A senior public health official in Israel recently stated that one of the reasons that country was able to acquire large quantities of doses was its good relationship with the pharmaceutical industry. This unfavourable environment has its roots in the Trudeau government of 1968 and the effective elimination of pharmaceutical patents. That lead to the hollowing-out of the innovative industry and the emergence of a generic-company oligopoly that was supported by successive Liberal governments. The Mulroney and Harper governments supported the innovative industry by improving the patent landscape but Canada only partially recovered and to this day does not have globally competitive patent protection. The negative trend continues even now with the imminent implementation of a punitive pricing regime through new federal (Patented Medicine Price Review Board) regulations. One now has to ask: where are the generic companies when we badly need innovation? Liberal government pharmaceutical policy has failed Canadians at our time of greatest need. Is Canada unable to acquire early vaccines because the federal government was late negotiating contracts with companies as it attempted to acquire domestic supply by funding three or four opportunities, including collaboration on the CanSino vaccine from China, that frankly had virtually no chance of succeeding? Or is it because Canada may not have been willing to pay a per-dose price that would have ensured significant early supply? Or, finally, is our initial supply small because Canada provided little to no funding for the development of the vaccines, unlike the contributions made by the U.S., U.K. and Germany? Operation Warp Speed in the U.S. contributed $12 billion to support accelerated development and manufacturing. It should be no surprise that the U.S. now has large quantities of vaccine. When it comes to vaccine supply Canada should be in the same position as these other leading countries. Instead, we are three to four months behind. How many more people will die in this pandemic who wouldn't have if the federal government had done a better job acquiring more early doses? How many more businesses will fail? How long will the lockdowns go on? Months matter in this struggle. Days matter. Unfortunately, Canadians are paying a steep price. Moving forward, Canada should start preparing for the inevitable next pandemic by establishing a constructive partnership between the federal government and the innovative pharmaceutical/life sciences industry. Canada needs to position the sector as one of our strategic industries — which, incredibly, it currently is not. The government needs to build a policy platform that will make Canada globally competitive in attracting innovation and investment. Part of that investment has to be domestic pandemic vaccine manufacturing capability. There should be no excuses next time.
